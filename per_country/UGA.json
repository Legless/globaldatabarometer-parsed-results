The Department gathers this data from different government institutions - Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD); Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT); Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF); the National Forestry Authority (NFA), National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA); National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC); Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS); Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA); Uganda Revenue Authority (URA); and other Local Governments. The Climate Change Department is responsible for managing and coordinating the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory that was established in 2011 with support from United Nations Development Programme. It is important to note that the Greenhouse Gas Inventory that has information or data on emissions is available for the public to access online but in pdf formats. This information is on both Ministry of Water and Environment's website. There are 2 reports - 2002 (1) and 2014 (2). The latest data in Uganda's First Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change published in September 2019 covers data for the period between 2005 and 2015 (3). The reports are available in English language being the official language as per the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995. The reports are not regularly published online which makes it difficult to tell if COVID-19 has affected the availability of this data.  \n\nSources:\n(1) MWE.

Recently the department released the Annual State of Disaster Report, 2020 which illustrates the disasters that happened in the country in 2020 and their accruing impact. It includes the experiences of victims and responders in the affected communities. The report highlights the needs of the affected persons and the response measures put in place by the government and partners as well as pending recovery needs (1). The department recently launched the National Risk and Vulnerability Atlas for Uganda. This document identifies areas in Uganda that are prone to disasters, the extent of the hazard, the probability and frequency of occurrence and the magnitude of their impact (2).

Additionally, the Government of Uganda is a running a COVID-19 Response Information Hub that provides data, information and resources to response actors working on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. This is supported by World Health Organisation (WHO), National Information Technology Authority of Uganda (NITA-U) and Uganda Learning Evidence,  Accountability and Research Network. The Ministry of Health also displays some information on its website on COVID-19 especially confirmed case for only Ugandans, cumulative Ugandan recoveries, samples tested and total vaccinated people. The data available on the COVID-19 Information Hub is available in English language, machine readable format and dates back from March 2020 to July 9th 2021. The website lacks some datasets such as information at the level of facilities, detailed information about the number and availability of regular beds and ICU beds, detailed information about the number and availability of medical devices or supplies, such as ventilators or oxygen cylinders, detailed information about the number, type, and availability of COVID-19 tests (2). There is a privately run website by  by the Association of Anesthesiologists of Uganda (AAU) indicating the available ICU beds http:\/\/www.anesthesiaug.org\/kampala-covid-19-icu-bed-dashboard\/ . This website has information on ICU beds for only Kampala (3). The COVID-19 Resurgence Plan June 2021 - June 2022 mentions that there is a total of about 144 ICU beds that were set up but not all were functioning due to staffing problems and lack of connectivity to oxygen. This report is in pdf format and available on the website of the Ministry of Health (4). The Ministry of Health on their website captures summarised information in pdf formats as press release and includes some information on the availability as well as total number of people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccines (5). There are also reports in media publishing information on COVID-19 cases, vaccination and capacity. For example, Daily Monitor, July 12th 2021 published a story on ICU beds in Uganda. The paper reports that Currently, the country has a bed capacity of 3,793 dedicated to manage Covid-19 patients. Of this, 3,100 are standard beds, 475 High Dependency Unit (HDU) beds and 218 are for ICU section. Of these, Mulago National Referral Hospital has the biggest capacity with 600 standard beds, 300 HDU bed and 27 ICU beds. All the regional referral hospitals combined have 900 standard beds, 115 HDU beds and 150 ICU beds. On average, each regional referral hospital has 10 ICU beds, much below the demand, forcing many to send away the excess patients (6). New Vision also publishes information on COVID-19 positive tested and death rates (7). The Twitter Account of the Ministry of Health has been publishing Daily COVID-19 Updates. Information shared in a summarized form includes cumulative cases, cumulative recoveries, active cases on admission at health facilities, tests conducted, new cases, deaths, test positivity rate and total doses administered (8).\n\n\nSources:\n\n(1).

In order to improve land use information dissemination, among the strategies include producing a current status report on - The State of Land use in Uganda, once every 5 years from urban and 10 years for rural areas (1). However, these reports are not anywhere online on the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development website. There is an attempt by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) to share data on land use on their website. This data covers a number of aspects that include - forests, agriculture, water bodies, wetlands over, built-up areas, among others. In addition, this information is also disseminated in the UBOS Annual Statistical Abstracts under the Environmental Statistical Section (2). The information on UBOS website is very limited and covers a few years. The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) also produces annual environmental reports that have some information on land use especially forest cover.

However, The Leadership Code Act 2002, Section 7 on declaration to be public states that - The content of a declaration under this code shall be treated as public information and shall be accessible to members of the public upon application to the Inspector General in the form prescribed under this Code (1). It is important to note that with effect from 1st June 2016, the Inspectorate of Government developed an online Declaration System that enables leaders to electronically fill and submit, their declaration forms to Inspector General of Government (IGG). The form, which is web based and accessible using internet browser is received and entered into the Leadership Code of Conduct (LCC) database. Previously, all declarations made to the Inspector General of Government by the Leaders, that is from 2002 to 2015 were done manually. This required all leaders to fill in hard copies of the forms and physically submit to the IGG. This system was expensive to both the IG and the leaders in terms of time, cost and human resource. In addition, there was need for data entrants to enter information on the forms into the database and these forms needed t lot of space for storage (2). Since the launch of the IG-ODS, over 25,000 leaders have been registered into the system and over 90% of them have successfully summitted their declarations online. The IG0-ODS has eased he process of data capture, search and retrieval. The Inspectorate of Government is working with NITA-U to develop protocols starting with the Land registry - to allow electronic synchronization of the declared data with the databases in other government agencies such as Uganda Revenue Authority, Uganda Registration Service Bureau, among others. This process will help to validate leaders' data as well as track the illicitly acquired assets which in turn ease the process of investing and asset recovery as the case may be (3). The IG-ODS Database contains personal financial information of high net worth public officers which aids asset tracing and verification as well as asset recovery (4).\n\n\nSources:\n(1).

Most of the cities and local governments are being supported by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) on data-related aspects in the country. For example, the Local Government Development Planning Guidelines indicate that - the Uganda Bureau of Statistics is responsible for providing reliable data for planning, technical advice and capacity building in data collection and management (1). The National Information Technology Authority of Uganda (NITA) has supported the development of over 45% of all local governments aimed at enhancing citizen interaction with the Government as well as easing access and use of electronic services offered by the public sector (2). There is an attempt of a few local governments through their Planning Units sharing some statistics inform of pdf reports on their websites but mostly generated by UBOS. For example, Kanungu district (3); Mayuge District (4); Kamuli district (5); Nebbi District (6); Katakwi district (7). The Kampala Capital City Authority Information Systems Strategic Plan, 2020-2026 priorities the development of an open data policy and implementation of an enterprise open data portal to allow citizens access to citizens (8). Data training to civil servants in local governments is mainly delivered by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics through the District Statistics and Capacity Building that is responsible for building capacity at the district level to collect, process and utilise statistics at that level (9). Both Department of Health and Education at the local government level collect data from different health facilities\/ schools and send it to the national level\/ ministries to be fed into Health Management Information System (10) and Education  Management Information System (11) respectively.\n\n\nSources\n(1) The Local Government Planning Guidelines 2014\nhttp:\/\/npa.go.ug\/wp-content\/uploads\/LG-PLANNING-GUIDELINES.pdf\n(2) National Information Technology Authority of Uganda (NITA-U)\nhttps:\/\/www.nita.go.ug\/service\/website-development\n(3) Kanungu District\nhttps:\/\/kanungu.go.ug\/about-us-2\/facts-figures\/\n(4) Mayuge District\nhttps:\/\/www.mayuge.go.ug\/planning-unit\n(5) Kamuli district\nhttps:\/\/www.kamuli.go.ug\/Statistics\n(6) Nebbi District\nhttp:\/\/nebbi.go.ug\/statistical-abstracts-2\/\n(7) Katakwi district\nhttps:\/\/katakwi.go.ug\/Statistics\nhttp:\/\/nebbi.go.ug\/statistical-abstracts-2\/\n(8) KCCA Information Systems Strategy 2020-2026\nhttps:\/\/www.kcca.go.ug\/media\/docs\/Information_Systems_Strategic_Plan%202020-2026.pdf\n(9) United Nations Statistics Division\nhttps:\/\/unstats.un.org\/unsd\/dnss\/docViewer.aspx?docID=675#start\n(10) Health Management Information System\nhttp:\/\/library.health.go.ug\/publications\/health-information-systems\/hmis\n(11) Education Management Information System\nhttp:\/\/www.education.go.ug\/emis\/","evidence":[{"title":"The Local Government Planning Guidelines 2014","link":"http:\/\/npa.go.ug\/wp-content\/uploads\/LG-PLANNING-GUIDELINES.pdf"},{"title":"KCCA Information Systems Strategy 2020-2026","link":"https:\/\/www.kcca.go.ug\/media\/docs\/Information_Systems_Strategic_Plan%202020-2026.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT","indicator_name":"Capability (C): Sub-national","indicator_name_medium":"Sub-national capabilities","indicator_name_short":"Sub-national capabilities","responses":[{"response_id":"40","response_text":"There is evidence of limited or ad-hoc capability to effectively manage data.","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"194","subquestion_text":"To what extent do city, regional, and local governments have the capability to effectively manage data?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.e.e1.ODINIT","subquestion_id":"195","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of local governments having open data initiatives."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.e.e1.ODPOLICY","subquestion_id":"196","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of local governments having current open data policies in place."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.e.e1.RULES","subquestion_id":"197","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of local governments having rules and or guidance in place to provide a comprehensive framework for data sharing."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.e.e1.DATAMANAGEMENT","subquestion_id":"198","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of local governments having rules and or guidance in place for consistent data management and publication."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.e.e1.TRAINING","subquestion_id":"234","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of local governments providing training to civil servants on data literacy and skills."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.e.e1.LOCALGOV","subquestion_id":"235","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of local governments providing support for data reuse."},{"response_id":"38","response_text":"The examples given are exceptions: the majority of cities and regions do not have the capacity to effectively manage data.","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"236","subquestion_text":"How widespread are local capacities to effectively manage data?"}]},{"score":"68","justification":"There is some evidence that the government in partnership with development partners are some trainings to civil servants to develop their data literacy and data skills.

This is mainly because these kinds of data sets are not online in open data formats. However, there is a mention of an attempt by the Inspectorate of Government working with the National Information Technology Authority of Uganda (NITA-U) to develop protocols starting with the Land Registry - to allow electronic synchronization of the declared data via the Inspectorate of Government Online Declaration System (IG-ODS) database with the databases in other government agencies such as Uganda Revenue Authority, Uganda Registration Authority, among others. This process will help to validate leaders' data as well as track the illicitly acquired assets which in turn ease the process of investigating and asset recovery as the case may be (1). Furthermore, the legal framework of the Leadership Code Act 2002 tries to link to Public Procurement. Section 12 of the Act prohibits contracts. Subsection 1 states that a leader, a leader's spouse, agent, private company or public company or business enterprise in which the leader, leader's spouse or agent has a controlling interest shall not seek, accept or hold any contract with - any government or public body which the leader controls or directly participates in the decision making of its affairs or any foreign business organisation where the contract is likely to be in conflict with the public interest; subsection 2 states that a leader who contravenes subsection 1 breaches this Code and is liable to - vacating office or to be dismissed from the office (2). Similarly, the Leadership (Amendment) Act 2021, section 12, subsection 4 states that a leader or a public officer shall not influence the award of a contract to - himself or herself, any person related to him or her by blood or by marriage, a business associate, agent or partner or a company, partnership or other entity or body in which the leader or the public officer, any person related to him or her by blood or marriage, has an interest (3). However, it is important to know that these datasets are not online and accessible by the public that makes it difficult to check the interoperability. In conclusion, efforts to connect various data portals has had limited success. As indicated above, most of the digital systems do not talk to each other and they release data or information online at different times and at different standards.\n\nSources:\n(1).

that provide a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal data. The Constitution of Uganda 1995, Article 27, Section 2 provides the grounding for the protection of personal data by prohibiting interference with the privacy of a person's home, correspondence, communication or other property (1). This provision was operationalized by The Data Protection and Privacy Act passed in February of 2019 and which provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of the individual the privacy and of personal data (2). This was followed by the development of the Data Protection and Privacy Regulations and approved in 2021 (3). There are cases of the Government of Uganda enforcing these legal frameworks. For example, Unwanted Witness petitioned the Speaker of Parliament against the SafeBoda app highlighting their failures to comply with data protection law that lead to the National Information Technology Authority Uganda (NITA-U) taking enforcement action of requesting the entity to make fundamental changes to how they handle people's personal data in particular in their information notices and data sharing practices (4). There are reports on how COVID-19 surveillance in Uganda is reducing people's data protection rights. For example, the Guidelines on COVID-19 Self Quarantine require individuals to provide their name, next of kin, physical address and telephone contact and permit the government surveillance teams to monitor individuals for 14 days (5). The Data Protection and Privacy Act 2019 is silent about budget allocations for implementation of this legal framework but it is important to note that it falls within the mandate of NITA-U. Lastly, the government of Uganda recently appointed the National Director of Personal Data Protection Office, an independent office under the National Information Technology Authority-Uganda (NITA-U)(6).\n\nSources:\n(1) The Constitution of Uganda, Article 27, Section 2, 1995 https:\/\/statehouse.go.ug\/sites\/default\/files\/attachments\/Constitution_1995.pdf \n(2)The Data Protection and Privacy Act, 2019\nhttps:\/\/ict.go.ug\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Data-Protection-and-Privacy-Act-2019.pdf\n(3) Data Protection and Privacy Regulations, 2021\nhttps:\/\/www.dataguidance.com\/sites\/default\/files\/uganda_data_protection_regulations_small.pdf\n(4) A win for Unwanted Witness: Uganda's data protection authority finds ride-sharing app unlawfully disclosed personal data to third parties \nhttps:\/\/privacyinternational.org\/news-analysis\/4459\/win-unwanted-witness-ugandas-data-protection-authority-finds-ride-sharing-app\n(5) ARTICLE 19 Eastern Africa, the Kenya ICT Action Network and Pollicy, 2021.

regulations, and policies that provide a comprehensive framework for generating and publishing government or public information online. The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995, provides basis for publishing public information. Article 41 provides ground for right to access public information. It states that - Every citizen has a right of access to information and records in the possession of the state or any public body, except where the release of information is likely to prejudice the security or sovereignty of the state or interfere with the right to the privacy of any other persons (1). As a result, Uganda adopted an Access to Information Act in 2005 (2) and its related Access to information Regulations in 2011 - where government institutions should appoint information officers to deal with public information requests that should be processed within 21 working days (3). Following the enactment of the Access to Information Act and its enabling regulations, the government of Uganda implemented a number of interventions to promote the right to access information and among these included the establishment of the Ministry of Information Communications and Technology and National Guidance (MICT&NG) with the mandate to formulate and implement ICT policies, sustain, manage and oversee ICT infrastructure in the country, among others. This Ministry has a department of Information dissemination and public relations under the directorate of Information and National Guidance (4). Through this Ministry, the government developed the National ICT Policy Framework, 2014 that enlists a number of interventions including but not limited to the implementation of government open data systems to enable citizens' access to government information as one of the priority e-government applications and services (5). In May 2017, the same Ministry of ICT developed the draft open data policy that provides a framework for opening up access to government data. However, there is no evidence that this policy was finalised and implemented. Until now, this policy has been in a draft form for the last 3 years without being officially endorsed and formally adopted (6). More recently, on 6th May 2021, Civil Society Organisations specifically - Twaweza Uganda and Africa Freedom of Information Centre in partnership with the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance officially launched the Access to Information Guide for Civil Servants aimed at building civil servants' capacity on operationalizing access to information (7). It is also important to note that a few government agencies have tried to create data platforms for sharing government information and data such as the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) for public consumption (8). This information is shared on their websites in different formats but mostly in pdf reports. The National Development Plan III (2020\/21-2024\/25) has prioritized improvement in statistical infrastructure (Human, Financial, IT infrastructure) in National Statistical System. The Plan has further prioritized increased statistical production and spatial data dissemination. It mentions that government data systems will be key for National Development Plan III implementation (9). \n\nSources:\n(1) The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995\nhttps:\/\/statehouse.go.ug\/sites\/default\/files\/attachments\/Constitution_1995.pdf\n(2) The Access to Information Act 2005\nhttp:\/\/library.health.go.ug\/publications\/laws-and-regulations\/access-information-act\n(3) The Access to Information Regulations, 2011\nhttps:\/\/chapterfouruganda.org\/resources\/acts-bills\/access-information-regulations-2011\n(4) Ministry of ICT and National Guidance Website\nhttps:\/\/ict.go.ug\/about-us\/\n(5) The National ICT Policy, 2014 \nhttps:\/\/ict.go.ug\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/ICT_Policy_2014.pdf\n(6) The Open Data Policy first draft, 2017 \nhttps:\/\/www.ict.go.ug\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Open-Data-Policy-First-Draft-vX.pdf\n(7)  Access to Information: A Guide for Civil Servants\nhttps:\/\/africafoicentre.org\/download\/access-to-information-guide-for-civil-servants\/\nhttps:\/\/twaweza.org\/access-to-info-guide-civil-servants\/\nhttps:\/\/ict.go.ug\/2021\/05\/10\/government-committed-to-citizens-access-to-information\/\n(8) Uganda Bureau of Statistics\nhttps:\/\/www.ubos.org\/\n(9) National Development Plan III 2020\/21-2024\/25\nhttp:\/\/www.npa.go.ug\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/NDPIII-Finale_Compressed.pdf","evidence":[{"title":"Access to information Act 2005","link":"https:\/\/chapterfouruganda.org\/sites\/default\/files\/downloads\/The-Access-to-Information-Act-2005.pdf"},{"title":"Open Data Policy","link":"https:\/\/www.ict.go.ug\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Open-Data-Policy-First-Draft-vX.pdf"},{"title":"The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda 1995","link":"https:\/\/statehouse.go.ug\/sites\/default\/files\/attachments\/Constitution_1995.pdf"},{"title":"The Access to Information Regulations, 2011","link":"https:\/\/chapterfouruganda.org\/resources\/acts-bills\/access-information-regulations-2011"},{"title":"Ministry of Information and Communications Technology and National Guidance","link":"https:\/\/ict.go.ug\/about-us\/"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Open data policy","indicator_name_medium":"Open data policy","indicator_name_short":"Open data policy","responses":[{"response_id":"13","response_text":"No framework exists.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.OPENDATA-DEF","subquestion_id":"207","subquestion_text":"The framework establishes a common definition of open data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.OPENLICENCES","subquestion_id":"206","subquestion_text":"The framework promotes open licensing without any restrictions beyond attribution and share-alike."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.MACHINE_READABLE","subquestion_id":"205","subquestion_text":"The framework requires to publish data in machine readable formats."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.STANDARDS","subquestion_id":"204","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance requires the use of specific data standards."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e2.CAPACITY","subquestion_id":"203","subquestion_text":"The framework promotes training and capacity building among government officials."}]},{"score":"65","justification":"The 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, Chapter 9, Articles 155-158, provide the legal basis for the preparation and approval of the national budget (1).

These two legal frameworks are under the mandate of the Inspectorate of Government established by the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 under Article 13 section 225 that grants it function to supervise the enforcement of the Leadership Code of Conduct (3). The Leadership Code Act 2002, section 7 talks about declaration to be public. It states that the contents of a declaration under this Code shall be treated as public information and shall be accessed to members of public upon application to the Inspector General in the form prescribed under this code. However, the format to publish this data is not described in what format such as open data.  As result, the Inspectorate of Government developed the IG-Online Declaration System (https:\/\/igdeclarations.igg.go.ug:8180\/) - a tool that enables leaders to submit their declarations of income, assets and liabilities online. The system was designed to make the declaration of income, assets and liabilities fast, efficient and effective; user friendly, easily accessible, secure, cheaper to both the leader and IG in terms of time and cost. Internally, the system will address the problem of data entry, search, analysis, comparison and extraction or retrieval. It will also solve the problem of storage space for manual declaration forms. The IG-ODS is operationalised by the Leadership Code (Declaration Form) Regulations, 2016 (4).\n\nSource:\n\n(1).

Specifically states that - Every citizen has a right of access to information and records in the possession of the state or any public body, except where the release of information is likely to prejudice the security or sovereignty of the state or interfere with the right to the privacy of any other persons (1). In order to enforce this, Uganda adopted an Access to Information Act in 2005 (2) and its related Access to information Regulations in 2011 - where government institutions should appoint information officers to deal with public information requests that should be processed within 21 working days. This law requires each Minister to submit an annual report to Parliament on requests for access to records or information made to public bodies under his or her ministry in relation to the relevant year and shall indicate whether access was given or not and if access was not given, state reasons for the denial(3). However, these laws do not have a requirement for collecting and publishing data on the performance of the right to information or freedom of information processes in any format including online and as open data. Despite the enactment of the Access to Information Act 2005, a study conducted by African Freedom of Information Centre (AFIC) revealed that over 90% of requests for information presented to government departments are rejected. While presenting their Report on Status of the Act implementation in Uganda, the institution indicated that the information requests to the selected Ministries, Departments and Agencies were denied, an indication of denial of the right to information to citizens. Furthermore, when citizens ask for information from the government institutions, they are questioned why they need the information yet the Act allows the public to access information save for what is exempted. The Act requires the Minister of ICT to present an annual report showing the requests for information received, information given or denied, this has never been done (4).\n\nSources:\n(1).
