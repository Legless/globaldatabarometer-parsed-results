The latest report produced in 2019 followed the standard set by UNFCCC and covered six gases from energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture, land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and waste sector (1). The UNFCCC website also contains previous editions in 2004 and 2012 (2)\n\nIn addition to the data published by national communication, data on emission also calculated and published by third parties as academic or civil society's efforts. For instance, Carbon Monitor project(3) produced science-based estimates of daily CO2emissions in different countries including China. The data is freely and openly published online for re-use. Another relevant initiative called China Emission Accounts and Datasets(4) published data on China emissions at national level and local level (covering over 30 provinces,180 cities and over 2700 counties) based upon peer-reviewed estimations. \n\nThe government itself also established internal system on reporting and monitoring emissions from key industry and factories.

The other system embedded into hospitals directly requires the reporting birth medical certification (3) and maternity information digitally through endpoint to a centralized system based upon a nation-wide standard(4) \nThe birth data is not available online and it seems not possible to request detailed information though FOI as it contains personal privacy but aggregated data might be available through FOI request.\n\n(1) The Chinese CRVS system move forward to the universal coverage, Cai Yue of Center for Health Statistics and Information of National Health and Family Planning Commission, 2017, Capacity building workshop for national civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) Focal Points,https:\/\/getinthepicture.org\/system\/files\/sites\/default\/files\/Session%203%20China%20Presentation_NFP%20workshop.pdf\n(2) death registration system data,  http:\/\/ncncd.chinacdc.cn\/jcysj\/siyinjcx\/syfxbg\/202101\/t20210118_223798.htm \n(3) sample of birth medical certification (sixth edition), http:\/\/www.nhc.gov.cn\/cms-search\/xxgk\/getManuscriptXxgk.htm?id=fe9f15f024b44e768d55e01a81c8681a\n(4) birth medical certification data standard (beta) , http:\/\/www.nhc.gov.cn\/mohwsbwstjxxzx\/s7968\/200905\/40710.shtml","evidence":[{"title":"Death Information Dataset (2019)","link":"http:\/\/ncncd.chinacdc.cn\/jcysj\/siyinjcx\/syfxbg\/202101\/W020210111605045433621.pdf"},{"title":"birth medical certification data standard (beta)","link":"http:\/\/www.nhc.gov.cn\/mohwsbwstjxxzx\/s7968\/200905\/40710.shtml"}],"indicator_id":"A.HEALTH.CRVS","indicator_name":"Availability (H): Vital statistics","indicator_name_medium":"Vital statistics","indicator_name_short":"Vital statistics","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e1.COMPLETENESS","subquestion_id":"125","subquestion_text":"The data includes information on data limitations, specifically on the completeness of vital statistics in different provinces, counties, or regions of the country."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e1.DEATH","subquestion_id":"126","subquestion_text":"Cause of death is standardized to the International Classification of Causes of Death (ICD) or a related, fully interoperable standard."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.MORTALITY","subquestion_id":"128","subquestion_text":"Mortality information includes data about age, sex and\/or gender, geographic location, and cause of death."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.CHILD","subquestion_id":"146","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about sex and\/or assigned gender of child, gestational age, and birth weight."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.LIVEBIRTH","subquestion_id":"42","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about live-birth order and interval between last and previous live births to mother."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.BIRTHDETAILS","subquestion_id":"127","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about place of occurrence, place of usual residence of mother, and month of occurrence."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.BIRTHREG","subquestion_id":"120","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about place of registration and month of registration."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.MATERNAL","subquestion_id":"119","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about age, educational attainment, and ethnic and\/or national group of mother."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.PATERNAL","subquestion_id":"147","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about age of father and place of usual residence."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.PRENATAL","subquestion_id":"133","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about site of delivery, attendant at birth, and month in which prenatal care began."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

Given this background, the city published information on its health commission website on a daily basis disclosing information on the capacity of each facilities, num of used bed and num of empty beds during the period of Feb 3rd to Feb 25th (1). After that period the government continuously published the data but for a different purpose as most designated hospitals now are no longer only serve COVID-19 patients but back to normal it is necessary to let general citizen understand which department of hospital back to normal and how many empty beds are available for non-COVID-19 patients (2). The data includes the name of facility, the departments back to normal ,num of empty beds and the percentage of beds in use .\nFor non-COVID practice, after online research it seems only few cities or hospitals start providing such information pulicly.

Under China's Land Administration Law (1), which was firstly drafted in 1986 and most recently amended in 2019.  the State owns all urban land, while farmer collectives own all rural land.The land ownership and land-use rights (LURs) is separated, and the state remains the land ownership and local government may transfer the LURs by laws on behalf of the state. Thus, private land ownership does not exist in China. \n\nIn urban areas of cities, lands are state-owned, what can be assigned, sold and resold, leased or mortgaged is the right of using within a fixed term.There are two types of land-use rights in China: the \"granted land use right\" (requires payment) and the \"allocated land use right.\"(for public interest without payment). The granted land use right is transferable by mortgage and lease, and may not be abrogated by the state except for compensation in the exercise of its right of eminent domain.\n\nLands in rural areas belong to peasants' collective ownership. A land-contracting tenure system is employed, called 'chengbao'(\u627f\u5305) in Chinese, according to Rural Land Contract Law promulgated in 2002. Land collectively owned by farmers may be contracted out to run by members of the collective economic organizations for crop farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries production under a term of 30 years.\n\n# Information\nLand Tenure information, according to the \"Interim Measures for inquiry of real estate registration data\" (\u4e0d\u52a8\u4ea7\u767b\u8bb0\u8d44\u6599\u67e5\u8be2\u6682\u884c\u529e\u6cd5), is available upon request but request can only be submitted through local government agency's window.  There is no digital online system for query yet. \n\nLand Use Rights information are proactively disclosed by the government through the website http:\/\/landchina.mnr.gov.cn\/. It is composed with two types: land lease and land transfer. Land lease refers to the state or local governments grant individual or legal person the use rights while Land transfer refers to the individual or legal person transfer the use rights on the free market to someone else.

The earliest policy document is the one issued in 2004 by the State Council on \"Advancing the re-use of information resources\" (1). Once entering into Big data era the state council's \"Action Plan for Advancing Big Data Industry\" in 2015 (2) marked the year where the Chinese government started the nationwide movement on pushing the re-use of data. Local governments such as Shanghai also released experimental and pioneering policy papers during the time of 2016-2021 on advancing the release and re-use of public data (3) as well as pushing forward the flow of private-sector data resources (4)\n\nActions are taken by governments to support and encourage data reuse include setting up a local government fund to stimulate the growth of the big data industry, setting up local gov grants to support innovative big data projects that re-use data, organizing local data competitions to reward activities re-using data especially for entrepreneurship. Some classic examples including Shanghai's SODA competition(5), Guiyang's Big Data Expo (6) and Beijing's Zhongguancun Big Data Alliance Forum (7) are tools employed by the government to advance the

publish open data and make new policies and laws on open data (1) while the national government itself has not yet launched open data portal and not released any nation-wide open data policy.\n\nRegarding policy and legal frameworks, the fact is there is no nation-wide open data specific framework yet but local governments already made some efforts on making such frameworks. For instance, Guiyang is the pioneer in making the very first open data-related policy but Shanghai's local open data framework (2) sets out the foundation for other local governments to adopt and localize. At least, there are 8 local governments make such framework for open data but there are also more than 30 local governmnents has framework on governing public data or governemnt data which also include sections on open data.(1)\n\nUsually the local commission for economy and informatizatiaon or the designated  Big Data Bureau is responsible for making the framework and enforcing it. The frameworks across china in common define open data as \"raw, reusable and machine readable data\" but categorize government data or public data into unconditonal open data, conditional open data and closed data which is significantly different from what is defined in the west (2). All local frameworks introduce mechanism to annually monitor and assess the implementation of open data across local departments but the level of enforcement varies\n\n(1): China Open Data Index Report (2020), Fudan University, http:\/\/www.ifopendata.cn\/static\/report\/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BC%80%E6%94%BE%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A%EF%BC%882020%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%89.pdf\n(2):Shanghai Open Data Act, 2019, https:\/\/www.shanghai.gov.cn\/nw48156\/20200825\/0001-48156_62825.html","evidence":[{"title":"China Open Data Index","link":"https:\/\/2021-files.globaldatabarometer.org\/171\/QuVwv60-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BC%80%E6%94%BE%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A%EF%BC%882020%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%89.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT","indicator_name":"Capability (C): Open data initiative","indicator_name_medium":"Open data initiative","indicator_name_short":"Open data initiative","responses":[{"response_id":"24","response_text":"There is evidence of an active government-led open government data initiative.","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"178","subquestion_text":"Has there been any form of government-led open government data initiative during the study period?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.TEAM","subquestion_id":"177","subquestion_text":"There is a government team in place supporting open data activities."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.BUDGET","subquestion_id":"176","subquestion_text":"There is an allocated budget for open data activities."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.PORTAL","subquestion_id":"174","subquestion_text":"There is a well-maintained open data portal."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.GUIDANCE","subquestion_id":"167","subquestion_text":"There is guidance and support for government publication of open data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.LEADERSHIP","subquestion_id":"173","subquestion_text":"Senior political leaders back the open data initiative."},{"response_id":"93","response_text":"The open data initiative covers only a limited part of the national government, but there are similar initiatives for many other parts of government.","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"172","subquestion_text":"How widely does this, or similar, open data initiatives apply?"}]},{"score":"66","justification":"Given the overall assessment, we found that most local governments do have the capacity in managing data effectively.

The aim of this project is to improve the accessibility of all levels of government websites by 2019.  Instead of directly modifying the websites , the project successfully involved many big corporations to provide technical supports  and tools to allow people with disabilities to leverage those tools to access website without barriers.

Since the introduction of Big Data to China in 2013, the Chinese government at national level pushes data sharing within gov with the release of Action Outline for Promoting the Development of Big Data (1) and the release of the Interim Measures for the Administration of Sharing of Government Information Resources (2). The G2G data sharing practice was dramatically improved and encouraged by the establishment of national government data sharing platform. By 2020, there are over 640K rows of and  1200 API listed on the platform. The data sharing services for particular verification or query purpose s(i.e. Verify identify of an individual based upon the input of name, ID num and phone num or query whether a given individual is married.) have reached over 0.175 billion times a month(3). At local level, Guizhou was the first local government making own local policy framwork on regulating public-sector data including a section on enforcing the data sharing within the government. Following Guiyang, local governments ranging from province-level to city or county-level made own policies on public-sector data. By 2020, at least 30 province-level governments  (total 34 in China) has such frameworks (4). In practice the movement of \"\u4e00\u7f51\u901a\u529e\" (all public service through one website) strongly accelerates the implementation of data sharing within gov and makes the impact and result of data sharing much more tangible.\nSecond, about G2B, the data flow from government to business is generally covered by open data policies in China. Especially after the redefinition of open data in 2019, the G2B data flow are well-covered by the local open data frameworks. Since 2021, as the national government defines data as the new production factor, data exchange (exchanging data product or service through free market) is also considered as a way to share government data in a form of product or service . In addition to open data framework, public-funded research data are shared with the public under the regulation on scientific data management(5). The national government also funds 20 scientific data sharing platform to share public-funded scientific data (6)\nThird, B2G data sharing already took place in China and there is a new trend in setting a governance framework to well-govern such B2G data sharing practices and re-balance power shift to big platforms. In 2015, the national government issued an opinion on leveraging big data to strengthen the services and supervision over market entities (7). It was the first time the national government formally introduced a two-way data sharing principle instead of just one-way data sharing (G2B). In practice,  big e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and Meituan, or dock-less bike sharing platforms such as OfO or Mobike already shared own data with governments to fill in the gap of statistics (8) or help improve governance (9).\nFinally, B2B data sharing already took practice but still lack strong governance framework. For a long term, B2B data sharing may occur in a grey zone and governments at all level took action especially after 2017-2018 period in enforcing law and shut down a lot of companies in sharing or selling data. New B2B data sharing models are under explored including data exchange ,data API and other methods. The action taken by government is to first strengthen the framework on data security in order to set the bottomline of what private sector can not do in terms of data sharing.

comprehensive framework regulating personal information protection yet though the \"Personal Information Protection Law\" (1) has been drafted for public consultation for two rounds during 2020-2021 and a third and final draft is expected to be reviewed in August 2021 and is expected to be passed within 2021. \n\nIn addition to the \"Personal Information Protection Law\", the framework on personal information protection has been dramatically developed in recent years especially during the period from 2016 to 2021. The \"CyberSecurity law\"  effective in 2017 (2), \"Information Security Technology \u2014 Personal Information Security Specification\"(3) effective in 2020 and  \"Civil Code\" (4) effective in 2021 as well as other fragmented sector-specific or issue-specific regulations, guidelines and specifications all together already make a robust and strong framework for personal information protection. The Cybersecurity Law sets out the legal principles and high-level requirements on protection of personal data collected and \/ or processed via the networks operators.  And the Article 111 of the Civil Code sets out the basic principle that natural person's personal data shall be protected by law; any organization and individuals must collect personal data after obtaining the personal data subject's consent and conduct the collection according to the law; they shall ensure the security of the personal data collected; illegal collection, using, processing and transmitting of others' personal data, illegal transaction of selling \/ purchasing personal data, and illegal provision \/ disclosure of personal data shall be prohibited.\n\nKey elements of Personal Information Protection are discussed below:\n\n- Choice and consent: The Civil Code Chapter 6 \"Privacy and Personal Information Protection\" layouts the general foundation and guidelines for personal information processing stating that first an individual must be well informed of the purposes and procedures of processing personal information and second an explicit consent must be obtained to legally process personal information . The Cybersecurity law (Article 41) and the draft of Personal Information Protection Law (Article 13) also provides similar statements. The Article 17 of the drafted Personal Information Protection Law also empowers the individual to access to service even without giving any consent to process personal information whenever it's possible.\n\nAbove frameworks also layouts exceptions for consent if allowed by relevant laws and regulations : for instance under the condition of a national security or public health emergency case, or  news report that is relevant to public interest.\n- Access and correction: The Civil Code Article 1037 empowers people the right to access and copy own personal information and has the right to correct and ask to delete information. The draft of Personal Information Protection Law specifies the data subject's right to access and correct own information. The article 44-45 grants the data subject's the right to know what information is held by the data handler and has the right to access. The article 46-47 empowers the data subject to correct and even delete relevant personal information. \n- Responsibilities on data holders:\n[a] taking steps to ensure personal information is updated and accurate; \nThe Article 8 of the draft Personal Information Protection Law states a general principle for personal information processing that high data quality is required so data should be accurate and up-to-date to avoid any possible negative impact on personal rights. \n[b] limiting access to personal data in accordance with its intended use; \nThe Article 14 of the draft Personal Information Protection Law requires that the data holder must re-obtain consent if the purpose of collecting and using personal information has been changed. Article 22 further requires that the data holder should be responsible for limiting the data access and use if the third party is contracted to process personal information.\n[c] only transferring data to third-parties if there are assurances they will also respect data protection rights\nArticle 23-24 requires that if transferring data to third-parties is necessary then the transfer should be agreed with the data subject and the third parties should process data under the original agreed purpose. If it is necessary to change the purpose of use, then new consent must be obtained. \n[d] destroying or anonymising data after it is no longer needed for its original intended use.\nArticle 47 of draft Personal Information Protection Law  requires that data holder should proactively delete personal information if it is no longer needed for its original intended use.\n- Rights of redress:\nThe Article 68 and 69 of draft Personal Information Protection Law empowers individual to ask compensation if personal informoation processing leads to any negative impact on the individual. In the case of multiple individuals or a collective are affected,  then relevant agency or authority has the right to sue the data holder on behalf of the group of individuals. \nThe independent oversight however is only limited to the designated authority while there is no specific Articles encourage civic society orgnaization to provide independent oversight. \n- Breach notification:\nThe Article 56 of draft Personal Information Protection Law requires that data holder should report the breach immediately to the individual and relevant agency and explain what information are breached and possible negative impact and consequences, why and how the information are breached, what has been done to minimize the negative impact and what actions are suggested to the impacted individuals.\nThe similar requirements were also covered by the Article 42 of Cybersecurity law, the section 10.2 of Personal Information Security Specification and Article 1038 of Civil Code.\n- Location data:\nThe location-related data is covered in the definition of what is personal information. The Civil law defined personal information includes personal location history information. \n- Algorithmic decision-making:\nThe Article 55 of draft Personal Information Protection Law  requires that data holders should conduct risk assessment  before employing any algorithmic decision making and keep assessment records for at least three years. \nThe Article 25 of draft Personal Information Protection Law requires the transparency and fairness of decision made by algorithmic system. It further empowers individuals to receive alternative decisions not based upon personal information,  seek explanation and refuse any decisions solely made by algorithmic system. \n\n\n\n(1)

initiatives, China takes a bottom-up approach where more than 170 local governments actively publish open data and make new policies and laws on open data (1) while the national government itself has not yet launched open data portal and not released any nation-wide open data policy.\n\nRegarding policy and legal frameworks, the fact is there is no nation-wide open data specific framework yet but local governments already made some efforts on making such frameworks. For instance, Guiyang is the pionner making the very first open data related policy but Shanghai's local open data framework (2) sets out the foundation for other local governments to adopt and localize. At least, there are 8 local governments make such framework for open data but there are also more than 30 local governmnents has framework on governing public data or governemnt data which also include sections on open data.(1)\n\nUsually the local commission for economy and informatizatiaon or the designated  Big Data Bureau is responsible for making the framework and enforcing it. The frameworks across china in common define open data as \"raw, reusable and machine readable data\" but categorize government data or public data into unconditonal open data, conditional open data and closed data which is significantly different from what is defined in the west (2).
