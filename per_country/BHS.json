However, this capacity seems to be limited because the information posted by its Health Information and Research Unit is dated. Their most recent posting used statistics from 2017, so there is no information on COVID-19. Information about hospital capacity may be obtained directly from the Ministry, hospitals, and from news outlets (3).
