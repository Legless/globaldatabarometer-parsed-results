In practice, however, there are discrepancies with their proper implementation (1). In 2020, the government adopted the Law on Ecological Information, which obliges all entities to disclose their environmental impact information to citizens (2). However, there is no such information available on the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection's website. Similarly, it was not located on the State Statistics Committee's website, although the government refers to the Committee's data on emissions in its Voluntary National Review on SDG implementation. The Review devotes a single line to this point, claiming that emissions were reduced by 20% in the 2015-2018 period (3). Turkmenistan last submitted National Communication to UNFCCC in 2016 (third); in March 2021, UNDP stated that the government was preparing its fourth report (4). However, there is no evidence that this information is available within the country in the form of open access data. \n\nSources \n\n(1) BTI Turkmenistan 2020 Country Report (Sustainability section), https:\/\/www.bti-project.org\/en\/reports\/country-report-TKM-2020.html#pos15 \n\n(2) The Law on Ecological Information adopted (in Russian), https:\/\/arzuw.news\/prinjat-zakon-turkmenistana-ob-jekologicheskoj-informacii\n\n(3) Voluntary National Review of Turkmenistan (p. 52), https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/turkmenistan\/media\/866\/file\/Voluntary%20National%20Review%20of%20Turkmenistan%20.pdf \n\n(4) UNDP actively supports the country's strategic initiatives in the field of climate change, https:\/\/turkmenistan.un.org\/en\/123046-undp-actively-supports-countrys-strategic-initiatives-field-climate-change","evidence":[{"title":"BTI Turkmenistan 2020 Country Report (Sustainability section)","link":"https:\/\/www.bti-project.org\/en\/reports\/country-report-TKM-2020.html#pos15"},{"title":"EBRD Turkmenistan Diagnostic May 2019 (p. 17)","link":"https:\/\/www.ebrd.com\/documents\/policy\/country-diagnostic-paper-turkmenistan.pdf?blobnocache=true"},{"title":"Voluntary National Review of Turkmenistan (p. 52)","link":"https:\/\/www.unicef.org\/turkmenistan\/media\/866\/file\/Voluntary%20National%20Review%20of%20Turkmenistan%20.pdf"},{"title":"UNDP actively supports the country's strategic initiatives in the field of climate change","link":"https:\/\/turkmenistan.un.org\/en\/123046-undp-actively-supports-countrys-strategic-initiatives-field-climate-change"},{"title":"The Law on Ecological Information Adopted (in Russian)","link":"https:\/\/arzuw.news\/prinjat-zakon-turkmenistana-ob-jekologicheskoj-informacii"}],"indicator_id":"A.CLIMATE.EMI","indicator_name":"Availability (CA): Emission","indicator_name_medium":"Emissions data","indicator_name_short":"Emissions","responses":[{"response_id":"6","response_text":"Data is not available online.","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.NATDETAIL","subquestion_id":"106","subquestion_text":"Nationally published data includes detailed information on greenhouse gas emissions and targets reported to the UNFCCC."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.SOURCES","subquestion_id":"104","subquestion_text":"Data contains detailed information on sources of greenhouse gas emissions."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.LANDUSE","subquestion_id":"97","subquestion_text":"Emissions data includes, or site where emissions data is made available links to, details of land use effects on emissions."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.EID","subquestion_id":"103","subquestion_text":"The dataset contains unique identifiers for greenhouse gas emissions that allow easy assessment across inventories, reduction commitments, and sources."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

Turkmenistan does publish an offline Red Data Book that includes information on a wide range of taxa. It is not clear from the CBD Sixth National Report whether the Red Book also contains a complementary green list; the Report, however, does include isolated references to recovering tendencies (1). There is also no clear indication that the data repository has mechanisms to support contributions from additional actors. The other shortcoming is the absence of timely updates in the Red Book dataset, which affects the inclusion of IUCN-defined endangered species under national protection (2). The most recent third edition was published in 2011; in 2021, the government stated to have been preparing the fourth edition (3). In 2020, the government adopted a Law on Ecological Information, which envisaged, among other things, the establishment of a centralized database of ecological information - the State Fund (4). Due to the lack of detailed and open information, it is challenging to assess how this law is exercised in practice.

However, the proposed database is intended for internal use only by the central and territorial departments of the State Statistics Committee and does not envisage public access.\n\n\nSources\n\n(1) Law on Entrepreneurship, https:\/\/minjust.gov.tm\/mcenter-single-ru\/268 \n\n(2) On registering business online (in Russian), https:\/\/turkmenportal.com\/blog\/29747\/zaregistrirovat-svoi-biznes-v-turkmenistane-teper-mozhno-v-onlainrezhime?fbclid=IwAR2Gxd5WosbyidWuHa1Lt5I26LWqKyPFk8quT1Y5mnDtDSi6RZ3LbYogvoo \n\n(3) UNDP Bid on developing a register of companies,  https:\/\/procurement-notices.undp.org\/view_file.cfm?doc_id=236004","evidence":[{"title":"Law on Entrepreneurship","link":"https:\/\/minjust.gov.tm\/mcenter-single-ru\/268"},{"title":"On registering business online (in Russian)","link":"https:\/\/turkmenportal.com\/blog\/29747\/zaregistrirovat-svoi-biznes-v-turkmenistane-teper-mozhno-v-onlainrezhime?fbclid=IwAR2Gxd5WosbyidWuHa1Lt5I26LWqKyPFk8quT1Y5mnDtDSi6RZ3LbYogvoo"},{"title":"UNDP Bid on developing a register of companies","link":"https:\/\/procurement-notices.undp.org\/view_file.cfm?doc_id=236004"}],"indicator_id":"A.COMPANY.REG","indicator_name":"Availability (CI): Company register","indicator_name_medium":"Company register data","indicator_name_short":"Company register","responses":[{"response_id":"6","response_text":"Data is not available online.","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e1.ORGID","subquestion_id":"28","subquestion_text":"The dataset contains unique identifiers for each company."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e1.BASIC","subquestion_id":"280","subquestion_text":"Basic company information, including company name, legal form, status, and registered address."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e1.DIRECTORS","subquestion_id":"281","subquestion_text":"The data contains details of each director."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e1.ACCOUNTS","subquestion_id":"282","subquestion_text":"Structured data on company accounts is available for each registered company."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e1.GENDER","subquestion_id":"23","subquestion_text":"Data includes information about individuals' sex and\/or gender."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.REG.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

Turkmenistan's budget and government spending data do not qualify as structured open data. According to the state media, the budget adoption process is preceded by discussions in all committees in the national parliament and all ministries and state agencies (1). There is no information beyond such generic statements about debates and deliberations by outlined entities about the document's content and objectives. In practice, the budget adoption process is highly centralized and significantly dominated by the presidency as any other socio-economic matter of the state. The parliament unanimously approves the budget. There are no formal opportunities offered to the public that allow meaningful participation or scrutiny in the different stages of the budget process. In addition, there are no genuinely independent oversight bodies that can perform this work. Turkmenistan only publishes the adopted budget in the form of the law for each year containing generic and aggregate revenue and expenditures information (the example is attached). There is no detailed breakdown by sector, purpose, and objective of the spending. Overall, Turkmenistan does not meet even minimal fiscal transparency requirements (2).\n\nSources\n\n(1) Turkmen parliament adopts a budget for 2021, Turkmenportal media outlet,

Tender processes are opaque and non-transparent; they are often accompanied by falsifying bids and canceling results (2). Government procurement is one of the most corrupt sectors. Contracts are predominantly awarded to companies that have managed to develop good relations with the government, either because of personal connections to the members of the highest political elite, willingness to pay kickbacks or to sponsor some prestige events for the ruling regime (3). The announcement of tenders in local media outlets, which also includes some online media platforms (i.e., Business Turkmenistan, Turkmenportal), is the main and often the only publicly available information on the tender process (4).

Neither of the two documents identifies the \"open data\" policy as a priority area or mentions it at all.   \n\nSource \n\n(1)Serdar Berdimuhamedov and Turkmenistan's Digital Transformation, https:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2021\/07\/serdar-berdimuhamedov-and-turkmenistans-digital-transformation\/","evidence":[{"title":"Serdar Berdimuhamedov and Turkmenistan\u2019s Digital Transformation","link":"https:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2021\/07\/serdar-berdimuhamedov-and-turkmenistans-digital-transformation\/"},{"title":"Turkmenistan's Digitalization Strategy: Old Practices, New Facade? in Digital Silk Road: Present and Future, pp.85-92","link":"https:\/\/daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/files\/2021-06\/Digital_Silk_Road_Report.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT","indicator_name":"Capability (C): Open data initiative","indicator_name_medium":"Open data initiative","indicator_name_short":"Open data initiative","responses":[{"response_id":"96","response_text":"There is no evidence of any government-led open government data initiative in the country.","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"178","subquestion_text":"Has there been any form of government-led open government data initiative during the study period?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.TEAM","subquestion_id":"177","subquestion_text":"There is a government team in place supporting open data activities."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.BUDGET","subquestion_id":"176","subquestion_text":"There is an allocated budget for open data activities."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.PORTAL","subquestion_id":"174","subquestion_text":"There is a well-maintained open data portal."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.GUIDANCE","subquestion_id":"167","subquestion_text":"There is guidance and support for government publication of open data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.LEADERSHIP","subquestion_id":"173","subquestion_text":"Senior political leaders back the open data initiative."}]},{"score":"0","justification":"Due to the lack of detailed information, it is challenging to accurately measure the level of sub-national officials' capability to manage data effectively.

In May 2019, Turkmenistan's President ordered public servants of all levels to undergo short training in \"basics of the digital economy\" (1), reflecting the country's shortage of skilled professionals. Since then, the Academy of Civil Service has developed and launched several programs focused on digitalization; due to the lack of detailed information, it is unclear how these efforts positively contribute to improving the effective management of data at the sub-national level.

The Academy's Master's program in Public Administration also contains a module on e-governance. Separately, OSCE and USAID also conduct short training courses on using information and communication technologies in public administration for public servants (4, 5). Despite these positive developments, the overall progress has been minimal and slow thus far. The training initiatives remain mostly short-term and isolated and involve a handful of national-level public servants.

Nonetheless, the framework implements the simplified approach suggested by the GDPR (2) and has noticeable gaps. The Law, for instance, does not require registration of a personal data database and notification of data subject to the data breach and does not envisage the appointment of a data protection officer. The framework also vaguely defines the exceptional cases when the consent of data subjects can be overridden in the name of protecting national security and constitutional rights and freedoms of the data subjects and other individuals, laying the groundwork for the potential abuse of office by security services and other state institutions. The protection of personal data is undermined further by the poor enforcement and lack of independent institutions safeguarding citizens from arbitrary and disproportionate interference (3), which is reflected in the country's poor human rights record (4). \n\nSources\n\n(1) Law of Turkmenistan No.519-V 'On Information about Private Life and its Protection,' 2017, http:\/\/www.worldlii.org\/int\/other\/NDPrivLegis\/2017\/13.html\n \n(2) DLA Piper, Data Protection Laws of the World: Turkmenistan, n.d., https:\/\/www.dlapiperdataprotection.com\/index.html?t=law&c=TM \n\n(3) Bertelsmann Stiftung Transformation Index, BTI 2020 Turkmenistan Country Report, https:\/\/www.bti-project.org\/en\/reports\/country-report-TKM-2020.html\n \n(4) 2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Turkmenistan, US Department of State, https:\/\/www.state.gov\/reports\/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices\/turkmenistan\/","evidence":[{"title":"Commentary to the Criminal Code of Turkmenistan (in Russian)","link":"https:\/\/www.osce.org\/files\/f\/documents\/b\/1\/117369.pdf"},{"title":"Turkmenistan: Law of 20 March 2017 on Information on Private Life and its Protection No. 519-V (in Russian) 2017","link":"NDPrivLegis 13 20 March 2017]http:\/\/www.worldlii.org\/int\/other\/NDPrivLegis\/2017\/13.html"},{"title":"A Look at New Trends: Privacy Laws in East, Central, and South Asia and the Pacific","link":"https:\/\/media2.mofo.com\/documents\/170602-privacy-laws-asia-pacific.pdf"},{"title":"BTI Transformation Index 2020: Turkmenistan","link":"https:\/\/www.bti-project.org\/en\/reports\/country-report-TKM-2020.html"},{"title":"2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Turkmenistan","link":"https:\/\/www.state.gov\/reports\/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices\/turkmenistan\/"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Data protection","indicator_name_medium":"Data protection law","indicator_name_short":"Data protection law","responses":[{"response_id":"10","response_text":"A framework exists and has the force of law.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.CONSENT","subquestion_id":"257","subquestion_text":"The framework provides data subjects with rights of choice or consent."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.ACCESS_CORRECTION","subquestion_id":"216","subquestion_text":"The framework provides data subjects with rights to access and correct data about themselves."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.DATA_HOLDER_RESPONSIBILITY","subquestion_id":"215","subquestion_text":"The framework sets out clear responsibilities for data holders."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.REDRESS","subquestion_id":"214","subquestion_text":"The framework provides rights of redress"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.BREACH","subquestion_id":"213","subquestion_text":"The framework requires data controllers to notify an appropriate authority of data breaches."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e2.LOCATION","subquestion_id":"212","subquestion_text":"Frameworks explicitly cover the protection of location-related data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"211","subquestion_text":"The framework addresses algorithmic decision making."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.eb.COVIDEXCEPTIONS","subquestion_id":"209","subquestion_text":"Exceptions to the usual data protection framework have been made as part of the country's COVID-19 response."},{"response_id":"20","response_text":"The framework applies widely across all sectors (including public and private sector).","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.c.SECTOR_EXTENT","subquestion_id":"202","subquestion_text":"How broadly does this data protection framework apply?"},{"response_id":"17","response_text":"The framework assessed, or equivalent frameworks, apply across the whole country.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.c.GEOGRAPHIC_SCOPE","subquestion_id":"208","subquestion_text":"Does this framework apply across the whole country?"}]},{"score":"0","justification":"Turkmenistan does not have a specific framework regulating the collection and processing of data in official and national languages.

The access to assets and successful business operation significantly depend on the benevolence of local authorities and close connections with political leadership. The state practically controls all agricultural land and enforces a purchase and trade monopoly for all agricultural products (2).

In 2021, journalists revealed, for instance, that companies belonging to the President's nephew and his close associates received lucrative food import contracts from the state (1). Journalists had to use the UK's company beneficial owner database to obtain such information (the companies were registered in the UK) as Turkmenistan keeps any information on procurement away from public scrutiny. In addition, no genuinely independent institutions, including civil society and mass media, can gain access to and use this data for red-flag analysis on potential fraud and corrupt practices due to the government's suppression. Despite officially stated ambitions to combat corruption, anti-corruption raids are mainly politically driven to punish officials fallen out of favor; they are sporadic, inconsistent, and do not combat the root causes of corruption (2, 3, 4).\n\nSources\n\n(1) As Turkmenistan's People go Hungry, President's Nephew Profits off Food Imports, OCCRP,
