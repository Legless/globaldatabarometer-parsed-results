Innovators have probably had ideas in this direction but unfortunately, the land data is still in the offices of the public bodies responsible for it. In Beninese sociology, it is information that is still little conveyed. Rational use of digital technologies in this sector can help mitigate the perverted effects observed if it is done by taking into account the weight of local sociology with respect to the land. Technology on its own will not be an obvious source of solutions to long-standing problems. Opening up land information to the general public can also have its share of social disaster in families where jealousy has taken on unimaginably harmful proportions. In conclusion, it is prudent to combine open data technology with the sociology of land uses to avoid obtaining effects contrary to the processes of democratization of land data.\n\nSource :\n(1) https:\/\/cadastre.bj\/","evidence":[],"indicator_id":"U.LAND.GENDERINCLUSION","indicator_name":"Use (L): Influencing policy for gender and inclusion","indicator_name_medium":"Gender and inclusion uses of data","indicator_name_short":"Gender and inclusion uses of data","responses":[{"response_id":"33","response_text":"No evidence of actors or entities using this data to influence policy in the interests of more equitable land tenure and use.","varname":"U.LAND.GENDERINCLUSION.a.EQUITABLE","subquestion_id":"269","subquestion_text":"Is there evidence of this data being used to influence policy in the interests of more equitable land tenure and use?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.LAND.GENDERINCLUSION.e.e1.CSO","subquestion_id":"251","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of civil society organizations using data in this way."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.LAND.GENDERINCLUSION.e.e1.MEDIA","subquestion_id":"250","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of media using data in this way."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.LAND.GENDERINCLUSION.e.e1.ACADEMIA","subquestion_id":"249","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of academics using data in this way."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.LAND.GENDERINCLUSION.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"248","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of the private sector using data in this way."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.LAND.GENDERINCLUSION.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"20","subquestion_text":"At least one of the examples identified describes using artificial Intelligence or machine learning to process data"}]},{"score":"0","justification":"There is no evidence on the integrity of government actions.
