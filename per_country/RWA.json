This is no different in Rwanda. The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) has, in close collaboration with the Ministry of ICT and innovation, been leading the way. On the African continent, Rwanda has relatively made some achievements since the early days of the so-called data revolution. It all began with passing access to information law, also known as freedom of information (FOI) back in 2013 (1);\n\nFour years later, that's in 2017, a data revolution policy was passed the government encompassing some aspects of open data. For instance, the policy recognizes that open data should be published by both public and private actors. Moreover, the policy goes on to define what is open data and how best it can be produced and published. Importantly, the policy advocates for the need to; have a centralised data portal, conduct capacity building in data management, eliminate the frequent silo-based way of data handling within government entities (2);\n\nBut, for personal data, the Government is on the move to tighten rules that govern how personal data and privacy. A new draft law on data protection and privacy was approved by the cabinet in October 2020 (3);\n\nIn 2020, a Draft law of Data Protection and Privacy was approved, its Chapter II and VII provide detailed guidelines for Data creation and data sharing and transfer (4);\n\nEarly 2013, a Law relating to Access to Information was enacted, among its purposes there is the establishment of modalities and procedures to promote the publication and dissemination of information(5).\n\nSources:\n(1): Shiru WANYOIKE.
