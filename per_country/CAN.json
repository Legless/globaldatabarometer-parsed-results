They recently conducted consultations for their 5th National Action Plan which is expected to be published in Fall 2021 (3). \nAfter leading the Open Government Partnership for a year as a co-chair, the Government of Canada hosted the 6th Open Government Partnership Global Summit in May 2019. \nThey have a multi-stakeholder forum that supports dialogue with civil society and provides continuous input on their initiatives. The official open government Canada website (open.canada.ca) compiles resources such as a searchable open data portal (that includes datasets, maps, apps, APIs, etc.) and the open government license
