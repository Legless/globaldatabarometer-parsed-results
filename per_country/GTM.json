Guatemala also does not have a regulatory authority that is responsible for controlling the use of personal data, its transfer, processing, commercialisation, and in general terms, its protection. In addition, attempts to issue specific regulation have failed. But there are alternative norms or laws that play a partial role in protection of personal data.\n\nThe Political Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala ('the Constitution') recognises privacy and data privacy rights as a constitutional right. (1) Articles one to five of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala implicitly recognises the right to human dignity and human rights that encompass a right to privacy. Article 23 of the Constitution also recognises dignity and the right to privacy in establishing the inviolability of housing, and Article 24 of the Constitution recognises the inviolability of every individual's correspondence, documents, and book-keeping, and provides that the privacy of correspondence by telephone, radio, cable, and other modes of modern digital technology is guaranteed. Furthermore, Article 30 of the Constitution establishes the public nature of administrative acts and recognises that individuals have the right to obtain public information from the administration. Article 31 of the Constitution determines that any individual has the right to know about all private and personal information recorded in public registries, and has the right to know about the purpose for which such information is recorded, as well as having the right to correct, rectify, and update such information. \n\nDecree No. 57-2008 on the Law on Access to Public Information ('the Law on Access to Public Information'), introduces key data protection concepts such as personal data and sensitive personal data (2). Nevertheless, the subject matter of this law is to secure the access to public information that is in possession of public authorities and obligated entities under the Law on Access to Public Information. The article 64 of the Law on Access to Public Information regulates the commercialisation of personal data and imposes sanctions (fines and imprisonment) to those that distribute, by any means, files containing personal data or sensitive personal data, which do not come from public registries, without the written consent of the data subject. \n\nIn a decision issued by the Constitutional Court, Case No. 3552-2014 of 10 February 2015 ('Case 3552-2014'), where the Ombudsman of Human Rights ('the Ombudsman') had filed a case against various private entities accused of gathering and commercialising private information from individuals without their consent. (3) Case 1356-2006 was emblematic in the sense that it was the first case in which the Constitutional Court decided to afford data privacy protection despite the absence of a law regulating this matter in detail. In particular, the Constitutional Court outlined, 'Once a person's right to determine the existence or nonexistence of registries or databases containing his\/her personal data is recognised, as well as their right to obtain the rectification, deletion or blocking thereto if the incorrect use of the data may affect his\/her intimacy and honour, the manner in which the judicial protection of such rights can be requested must be determined. It is known that in comparative law and in accordance with procedural constitutional modern doctrine, the protection of such rights is done through the action of 'habeas data', which has not been regulated in Guatemala. This case is important and of great relevance because it introduced the right to privacy in Guatemala in the absence of specific data protection legislation.\n\nIn the absence of such a law, and while such a situation prevails in the country, this court holds that given the nature and ample scope of the constitutional remedy of legal actions such as 'amparo', amparo is the appropriate constitutional action destined to guarantee the right of every person to access their personal data kept in private or official databases or registries.'\n\n\n\n## Sources\n(1):  Political Constitution Of The Republic Of Guatemala.
