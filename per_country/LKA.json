Vital statistics cover the entire Island.\" However, the annual reports could not be found online. \n\nOn the website of the Registrar General's Department, in the \"Civil Registration\" Section (2), there is a report on Vital Statistics for the years 2008-2017 (3). The report includes, in PDF form, tables including total figures on births, marriages, deaths, causes of deaths, etc. However, the time period of this data is out of the Global Data Barometer's scope. \n\nThe Department of Census and Statistics (4) contains PDF files with tables on the Crude Birth Rates & Crude Death Rates by Province, District & Sex, 2019 - 2020 (per 1000 persons) (5), Number of Births, Deaths and Marriages registered by District, 2019-2020 (6) and Number of Births, Deaths, Marriages , Infant Mortality Rate , Under Five Mortality Rate and Maternal Mortality Rate, 2000 - 2019 (7). However, these figures do not include \"at least details about about the child, the birth, parents, and the registration process\" for births or \"at least data about age, sex, geographic location, and cause of death\" for mortality, as required by the GDB handbook. \n\nA report released in July 2018 by the University of\nMelbourne, Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative observed that \"Sri Lanka has a well established CRVS system with very high completeness rates for births and deaths\" (pg. 5). However, \"the quality of Sri Lanka's mortality statistics produced by the civil registration system is low and this has resulted in the nation having a weaker CRVS system than expected\" (pg. 6). The report also notes that activities to strengthen CRVS are taking place in Sri Lanka, for example its \"involvement in the Data for Health (D4H) Initiative, a sixteen-country and two-city initiative for CRVS systems strengthening and capacity building. On joining D4H in 2015, a Technical Working Group was formed to guide the implementation of the selected improvement activities. This high-level Technical Working Group comprises staff with diverse experience and knowledge on CRVS from the Ministry of Health and Registrar General's Department, including consultant community physicians, consultant surgeons, consultant forensic\npathologists, statisticians, as well as the Assistant Registrar General\" (pg. 8) (8). \n\nOverall, Sri Lanka appears to have good systems in place for CRVS, and has worked to strengthen existing systems. However, CRVS data cannot be found online as  open data.\n\nSources\n(1) Sri Lanka's Department of Census and Statistics' Statistical Abstract 2019 http:\/\/www.statistics.gov.lk\/abstract2019\/CHAP3\n(2) website of the Registrar General's Department,  \"Civil Registration\" http:\/\/www.rgd.gov.lk\/web\/index.php\/en\/statistics2\/civil-registartion.html\n(3) report on Vital Statistics for the years 2008-2017 http:\/\/www.rgd.gov.lk\/web\/images\/pdf\/VITAL-STATISTICS-REPORT-2008-2017.pdf\n(4) The Department of Census and Statistics Website http:\/\/www.statistics.gov.lk\/Population\/StaticalInformation\/VitalStatistics\n(5) Crude Birth Rates & Crude Death Rates by Province, District & Sex, 2019 -

This will enable data sharing, avoid duplication in data collection, increase efficiency and collaboration among organizations.\nCurrently, NSDI Phase I system has been developed which includes a National Map Portal, a Metadata Catalogue, the Website (www.nsdi.gov.lk) and Five Use Case Applications to demonstrate the functionalities of NSDI and its benefits. It allows users to discover, view and obtain spatial information online for a particular part of the country without needing to know the details of how the data is stored and maintained by independent organizations\"(1). \n\nFurthermore, in 2018, \"The State of Sri Lankan Cities\" database, a project of UN Habitat Sri Lanka, \"is a platform that brings together spatial and statistical data for urban planners and decision makers.

However, a lack of compliance by public authorities with Section 10 of the RTI Act is noted:\n\"Section 10 of the RTI Act states that \"Every public authority shall submit annual reports to the Commission before the thirty-first day of December immediately succeeding the year to which the report relates. It further provides that the report shall be made available to the public in its office and on its official website. Irrespective of the fact that the submission of this report is mandatory in terms of the provisions of the Act. It has been observed that only a very few Public Authorities have adhered to this legal requirement and submitted Annual\nReports to the RTIC by end of December 31, 2018, in respect of the year 2017, the year in which the Act came into force.\nThe Commission has received 111 (7.0%) annual reports for 2017 and 219 (13.9%) annual reports for 2018. Of these 219 annual reports, 163 (74.4%) have been found incomplete, vide Table 11. The number of Public Authorities in the State Sector has been estimated as 1579 i.e, under Provincial Councils 718 and in the Central Government 861.\" \n\nHence there appears to be a dearth of data and gaps in reporting on RTI processes.\n\nSources:\n(1) Annual Report 2019: Right to Information Commission, Sri Lanka. http:\/\/www.rticommission.lk\/web\/images\/pdf\/annual_report\/annual-report-2019-eng.pdf","evidence":[],"indicator_id":"A.PI.RTI","indicator_name":"Availability (PI): RTI performance data","indicator_name_medium":"RTI performance data","indicator_name_short":"RTI performance","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.PI.RTI.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e1.NREQ","subquestion_id":"88","subquestion_text":"The dataset includes details on the number of requests submitted and processed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e1.RESPONSE","subquestion_id":"86","subquestion_text":"The dataset includes details on how long it took the relevant government agency or agencies to fill requests."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e1.WITHHELD","subquestion_id":"79","subquestion_text":"The dataset includes details about material withheld and the reasons for withholding it."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e1.APPEALS","subquestion_id":"85","subquestion_text":"The dataset includes details about appeals to RTI determinations and their results."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e1.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"84","subquestion_text":"Data is linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.RTI.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.
