While Data.gov.au,2 (established in 2011) provided a central, free repository utilised by Federal, State, and Local governments, the Policy recommendations were not universally implemented consistently. Some local councils and jurisdictions implemented their own Open Data Policies with different objectives and targeted KPI's relating to the number of data sets released, to either their own sub-page on the data.gov.au page or their own separate platform.

(1) The author of the report claims the disclosure scheme is almost designed to be ineffectual and lacks the \"teeth\" to kerb impropriety, while disclosures may raise suspicion - the lax reporting requirements mean only casual links are establishable in lieu of a full police investigation. pg24 (ibid, 1).\n\nThe report also indicates that political parties are flouting their obligations under the scheme with little consequence. pg. 18.
