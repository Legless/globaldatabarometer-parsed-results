In line with the adopted development priorities, the role of public oversight and civil society institutions has been significantly strengthened, with a special focus on improving the transparency and quality of public services through information and communication technologies.\nSome measures are being taken in this direction in the country, in particular, the Open Sector of the Republic of Uzbekistan, which in March 2015 will be able to publish socio-economic and socio-political information in various machine-readable formats. The Open Data Portal [2] (hereinafter - portal) has been launched.\nThe order of formation, placement and processing of open data, the list of open data sets of government agencies and organizations, published by government agencies on their official websites, and the Portal were approved. To date, the Portal has hosted more than 11,000 open data sets from 149 ministries and agencies, and the number of downloads has exceeded 7.5 million[3].\nHowever, despite the work done, several problems limit the development of open data, the publication of which in most government agencies is not a voluntary initiative to improve public life and increase the transparency of government agencies.\nThe trend is due to some factors, including:\nThe outdated regulatory and methodological framework that does not meet modern requirements, which leads to shortcomings in the regulation of the Portal;\nlack of an effective feedback system that takes into account the views and needs of the population and businesses in the formation and publication of open data;\nLimited technical capabilities of the Portal for timely processing and updating of information posted on the Portal;\nlack of control system for timely updating of data, ensuring their timeliness, and monitoring the results of public disclosure;\nclosure of government agencies not only for citizens and businesses but also for other government agencies in interdepartmental electronic cooperation;\nthese include strict principles for handling personal data that impede the transparency of public authorities.\n\n\nSources: \n1.

In this course, students complete a 576-hour program and at the end of the course defend their dissertation, with successful graduates being awarded a standard diploma. The refresher course is designed for all categories of employees working in government statistics and lasts at least 36 hours. Individuals who are newly hired into the system, but do not have the relevant experience and qualifications, are required to take advanced training courses within one month from the date of employment. In addition, employees transferring to higher organizations within the system must improve their skills in the relevant training courses within the next three months from the date of transfer to the new position. In general, according to the current procedure, every employee working in the system should be covered by advanced training courses at least once every two years. Students who have completed advanced training courses will be issued a certificate in the prescribed form.\n\nAdditionally, from March 1 to March 31, 2021, the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics[2] organized training sessions on preliminary preparation for conducting multi-indicator cluster surveys. The training was attended by selected supervisors and interviewers from the Republic of Karakalpakstan, the city of Tashkent, and other regions.\nThe training took place in two stages. At the first stage, the participants were given the concepts of multi-indicator cluster surveys, the structure of the questionnaires, the content and essence of the questions. In the questionnaires, knowledge, and skills were given on the correct, understandable transmission of questions to respondents, and the conduct of surveys.\nAt the second stage, trial surveys were carried out in the selected mahallas of the Yunusabad district of the capital, Zangiotinsky, and Yangiyul districts of the Tashkent region. Plates were used in trial surveys.\nFor information: starting from April 5 of this year, the survey process will be collected electronically on tablets in 14,520 households located in 726 selected mahallas in the Republic of Uzbekistan, through personal conversations with respondents in the field.\nAs a result of the training, about 100 supervisors and interviewers selected from the Republic of Karakalpakstan, the city of Tashkent, and regions were awarded special certificates from the State Statistics Committee and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).\n\nhttps:\/\/stat.uz\/en\/press-center\/news-of-committee\/8668-o-quv-mashg-ulotlarini-muvaffaqiyatli-tugatgan-mics-ishtirokchilariga-sertifikatlar-topshirildi-3\n\nSource:\n1.

Organizations\"[1], the database of the Unified State Register of Enterprises and Organizations is maintained.\n\nStarting from March 4, 2021, the state registration of a new company in Uzbekistan requires the disclosure of its ultimate beneficiary owner (UBO). Government resolution no. 763 dated December 2, 2020 (Resolution 763)[2], has revolutionized the registration procedure that has existed in the country since 2017.\n\nResolution 763 defines the UBO as an actual owner of the property of a newly created company or an individual who controls an applicant, or whose interests drive money and other property-related transactions. The definition does not set any thresholds or percentages as to the ownership or control over the applicant by a founding individual or entity to identify a UBO. Resolution 763 does not clearly identify the applicant; hence, we presume it refers to a founding individual.\n\nUpon registration, an applicant will be required to disclose the UBO by filling in a questionnaire (to be submitted alongside a standard registration package) electronically. The questionnaire identifies particulars of the UBO of the new company, namely:\n\nfull name;\ndate of birth;\nnationality;\nresidential address;\ndetails of ID;\ntax identification number (if relevant); and\ncontact details (e-mail, phone number).\nHowever, the definition of \"company founder\" emphasized here may not meet the criteria of beneficial ownership.

submitted for public discussion.\nIt was noted that the draft law is designed to create a legal framework for regulating relations in the field of civil service.\n\nArticle 3 of the draft law defines the application of this law to all civil servants of the Republic of Uzbekistan, except for the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, deputies of the Legislative Chamber and members of the Senate of the Oliy Majlis, the Central Election Commission of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Ombudsman, the Jo'qorg'i Kengesi of the Republic of Karakalpakstan and representative bodies of state power and for judges.\nAccording to global experience, the officials listed above fall into the category of political servants, not civil servants.\n\nArticle 18. Declaration of income, property, and large expanses of civil servants and their families.\n\nEvery year, civil servants are required to file a declaration of income, property, and a large number of expenses for themselves and their family members in the manner prescribed by law.\n\nThe list established by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan may establish additional requirements for the declaration of income, property, and a large number of expenses of certain categories of civil servants, including an extended range of their close relatives.\n\nCandidates for civil service must submit a declaration of income, property, and large expanses of themselves and their family members at the time of employment in the civil service. Information on the submission of the declaration is checked by the personnel department before the candidate enters the civil service.\n\nArticle 59 Grounds for termination of public civil service.\n\nFailure to submit a declaration of income, property, and large expenses of a civil servant and family members, violation of the deadlines for submission of intentional submission of incomplete or incorrect information is one of the grounds for termination of the Civil Service.\n\nDeputy Minister of Justice Bahrom Kuchkarov[2] explained why the draft law \"On Civil Service\" provides for exceptions for officials. The legal status of governors is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Constitution of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, and other laws, so the law \"On Civil Service\" is applicable to parts not previously regulated by law.\n He also noted that the draft declaration partially covers the issue of declaration and does not provide a declaration procedure, because it is a separate procedure, a separate process. It applies to everyone, so it is the same thing. This is a separate element of the anti-corruption system. It is therefore partially reflected here.\n\n Sources:\n1.
