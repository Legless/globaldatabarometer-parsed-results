However, the draft Access to Information Law will provide a more robust framework for sharing sensitive government data with the public in the future. It specifies both which information public institutions may refuse to release and how confidential information may be provided. The only example located of data considered sensitive that have been publicly released is the recent disclosure of names and addresses of Covid-19 infected individuals (made possible by the recent promulgation of a law to prevent the spread of the coronavirus). The draft cybercrime law and the recently adopted sub-decree on a National Internet Gateway are seen by human rights organisations as a veiled attempt by the Cambodian government to restrict freedom of expression rather than a sincere effort to control the spread of harmful information via the internet.\n(1) Ministry of Information. 2020.

Cambodia's Ministry of Interior announced on 26 January 2021 that its lawyers and data specialists had met to discuss an initial draft of a sub-decree consisting of six chapters and 16 articles on the management, use, privacy and security of data collected by the government that can potentially be used to identify individuals (see https:\/\/www.phnompenhpost.com\/national\/ministry-interior-working-privacy-protections-data). There is no information on when the drafting process will be completed. Cambodia is also working on reviewing and updating its draft cybercrime law, which contains specific data protection clauses that address preservation of data during criminal investigations, search and seizure of computer data for use as evidence, and potential safeguards for suspects to prevent data privacy abuses. Suggested fines and\/or terms of imprisonment have been outlined in the Draft Law for potential cybercrime offences, which include accessing a computer system without a legal right and engaging in data espionage, illegal interception of non-public computer transmissions, and data interference, among others. The draft cybercrime law, originally drafted in 2016, is still pending final approval. In mid-2019, the Cambodian government announced that it was reviewing the draft law to ensure its consistency with current laws and to better outline potential punishments for offenses of it. A third draft was allegedly completed in mid-2020, but none of the drafts have been shared with the public or consulted with civil society organisations or local or international experts.

The adoption of an Access to Information Law is still pending. Although the draft law establishes the principle of \"maximum disclosure\" in government bodies at both national and sub-national levels, it has been criticized for its many ambiguous provisions and unclear definitions and omitting vital components of exemplary access to information legislation. According to OECD, Cambodia has one of the lowest scores in the South-East Asia Open-Useful-Reuseable Government Data Index. Despite the lack of a legal framework, some NGOs manage to collect and publish government data on various topics - foremost among these NGOs is Open Development Cambodia. Also, the Cambodian government has launched a series of initiatives to reform how government bodies provide public services and organize and store data. These e-government initiatives will also make it easier for citizens to access (some) government data. In other words, there seems to be a discrepancy between the Cambodian government's clear intentions to make the provision of public services more efficient through increased use of ICT and the vague definitions of the draft law on access to information that cast doubt on its commitment to promoting the reuse of public data.\n(1) Ministry of Information. 2020.

In other words: It is a practice or policy (within some areas of government), not a legal requirement. Public consultations on the implementation of government policies\/development plans are regularly held at the sub-national level, where it is a formal requirement according to the law on sub-national (provincial, district and commune) administrations. Legislation has also been developed for how to organize public consultations at the sub-national level (see https:\/\/www.pic.org.kh\/index.php\/en\/events-eng\/9-seminar-public-consultation-guidelines.html).

Following the ban on the main opposition party in late 2017, a culture of self-censorship has taken root in the media sector in the country, which has significantly limited the publication of newspaper articles on controversial topics. On the other hand, pressure from the private sector, including members of the European Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, has had a positive effect on trade facilitation.\nSources: \n(1) Licadho research on Economic Land Concessions. https:\/\/www.licadho-cambodia.org\/land_concessions\/\n(2) Cooperation Committee for Cambodia statement on the LANGO. https:\/\/www.ccc-cambodia.org\/en\/media-center\/latest-news\/cso-leaders-meetingroadmap-and-post-lango-consultation\n(3) Corruption Perceptions in Cambodian SMEs.
