In the Guidelines for conserving connectivity through ecological networks and corridors, IUCN criticizes Romania for the way it manages its natural heritage, due to pollution caused by investments in the electricity generation industry, for example, protected species are endangered. (1) Environmental organizations are the entities that constantly fight for the protection of the environment, flora and fauna, blocking polluting projects by suing the Romanian state. For example, Bankwatch Romania and Agent Green managed in 2020 to block in the first court the project for the construction of the Bumbe\u0219ti - Livezeni Hydropower Plant, built in the middle of the Jiu Gorge National Park. The biggest controversy in Romania regarding the management of endangered species is that although it is part of the Platform on Coexistence between People and Large Carnivores, and the hunting of bear trophies is banned nationally since 2016, the Ministry of Environment proves lack of transparency in that the rules on hunting derogations are ambiguous and the selection of specimens is left to the discretion of hunting associations. In other words, being a protected species - a bear (male only) can be hunted only if it is a danger. However, due to the lack of regulations on the selection of the specimen in question, hunting associations that receive derogations often hunt large specimens, which can be considered trophies, not specimens that are really a problem. Thus, a problem that endangers both human life and the welfare of the species remains.\n(1)\tIUCN, Guidelines for conserving connectivity through ecological networks and corridors, https:\/\/portals.iucn.org\/library\/sites\/library\/files\/documents\/PAG-030-En.pdf\n(2)\tAgent Green, press release on bear trophy hunting allowed by the Ministry of Environment https:\/\/www.agentgreen.ro\/ministerul-mediului-pe-cale-de-a-deschide-sezonul-la-vanatoarea-ursilor-pentru-trofee\/","evidence":[{"title":"IUCN, Guidelines for conserving connectivity through ecological networks and corridors","link":"https:\/\/portals.iucn.org\/library\/sites\/library\/files\/documents\/PAG-030-En.pdf"},{"title":"Agent Green, press release on bear trophy hunting allowed by the Ministry of Environment","link":"https:\/\/www.agentgreen.ro\/ministerul-mediului-pe-cale-de-a-deschide-sezonul-la-vanatoarea-ursilor-pentru-trofee\/"}],"indicator_id":"A.CLIMATE.BIO","indicator_name":"Availability (CA): Biodiversity","indicator_name_medium":"Biodiversity data","indicator_name_short":"Biodiversity","responses":[{"response_id":"6","response_text":"Data is not available online.","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.MAMMALS","subquestion_id":"102","subquestion_text":"Data includes mammals."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.BIRDS","subquestion_id":"101","subquestion_text":"Data includes birds."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.REPTILES","subquestion_id":"100","subquestion_text":"Data includes reptiles."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.AMPHIBIANS","subquestion_id":"99","subquestion_text":"Data includes amphibians."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.FISH","subquestion_id":"98","subquestion_text":"Data includes fish."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.INVERTEBRATES","subquestion_id":"112","subquestion_text":"Data includes invertebrates."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.FUNGI","subquestion_id":"113","subquestion_text":"Data includes fungi and lichen."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.NVP","subquestion_id":"114","subquestion_text":"Data includes non-vascular plants."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.VP","subquestion_id":"115","subquestion_text":"Data includes vascular plants."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.GREENLIST","subquestion_id":"116","subquestion_text":"Data includes a \"green\" list, or detailed information on species or ecosystems recovering from danger, threat, or vulnerability."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.STANDARDS","subquestion_id":"22","subquestion_text":"The data is published according to one or more relevant data standards."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.VALIDATION","subquestion_id":"117","subquestion_text":"Data is nationally validated by the government."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.CONTRIB","subquestion_id":"27","subquestion_text":"A mechanism allows additional actors to contribute to the data repository."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.LIMITS","subquestion_id":"118","subquestion_text":"Limitations of the data are clearly stated."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

LAW no. 363 of December 28, 2018 on protection natural persons regarding the processing of data with personal data by the competent authorities in the purpose of prevention, discovery, investigation, prosecution and combating crime or the execution of sentences, educational and safety measures, as well as on free movement of this data (1) is the law that treats some of the data-sharing aspects in Romania. It was adopted after entering into force of the EU Regulation 2016\/679. This law is especially applied when the personal data sharing occurs between public institutions. Regarding the sharing between private entities, the EU Regulation 2016\/679 has a whole chapter about the transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations (chapter V). The European Commission launched in November 2020 the proposal for a Regulation on European data governance (Data Governance Act) in order to increase the trust in data intermediaries and to strengthen the data-sharing mechanisms across the EU (2). Before that, in February 2020, the Commission launched the European Data Strategy, with the purpose to create a single market for data for the benefit of businesses, researchers and public administrations (3). Data Governance Act remains still as a proposal, because there are parts that breach the GDPR law.\nAs of 2018, Regulation (EU) 2018\/1807 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the European Union applies to all Member States (4). Together with the Open Data Directive, important parts of what \"data sharing\" means are covered, but the two normative acts often conflict with GDPR legislation, whereby almost any information can be considered personal.\nTherefore, the issue of data sharing in Romania is a complicated one to address, due to the multiple legislative conflicts between data transfer and personal data protection.\nSources: \n(1): https:\/\/www.dataprotection.ro\/servlet\/ViewDocument?id=1620 \n(2): https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0767&from=EN \n(3):https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/priorities-2019-2024\/europe-fit-digital-age\/european-data-strategy_en \n(4):https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32018R1807&from=EN#d1e475-59-1","evidence":[{"title":"Data Protection Law","link":"https:\/\/www.dataprotection.ro\/servlet\/ViewDocument?id=1620"},{"title":"European Data Governance Act","link":"https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0767&from=EN"},{"title":"European data strategy","link":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/priorities-2019-2024\/europe-fit-digital-age\/european-data-strategy_en"},{"title":"REGULATION (EU) 2018\/1807","link":"https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/legal-content\/EN\/TXT\/HTML\/?uri=CELEX:32018R1807&from=EN#d1e475-59-1"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Data sharing frameworks","indicator_name_medium":"Data sharing frameworks","indicator_name_short":"Data sharing frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"10","response_text":"A framework exists and has the force of law.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.GOV_INTERNAL","subquestion_id":"218","subquestion_text":"The framework covers data sharing within government."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.GOV_OTHERS","subquestion_id":"219","subquestion_text":"The framework covers how government should share data with other sectors."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.OTHTOGOV","subquestion_id":"220","subquestion_text":"The framework covers data sharing from other sectors to government."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"221","subquestion_text":"The framework covers data sharing within the private sector."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"222","subquestion_text":"The framework explicitly focuses on artificial intelligence uses of data."},{"response_id":"39","response_text":"The framework assessed covers all government agencies, and many themes.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.c.DSF","subquestion_id":"223","subquestion_text":"How broad is the coverage of legal or policy frameworks for data sharing for the public good?"},{"response_id":"8","response_text":"They provide national coverage.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"18","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive, in terms of jurisdiction, is the coverage of the laws, regulations, policies, or guidance assessed for this question?"}]},{"score":"100","justification":"In 2016, the Regulation on the protection of personal data entered into force throughout the European Union, therefore Romania is a state that applies Regulation 2016\/679, together with Law 190\/2018 on measures to implement Regulation (EU) 2016 \/ 679. The Romanian public institution that has the general competence in the field of personal data protection is the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data (1). The Regulation on the protection of personal data is one of the most complex normative acts in the world on this subject and deals with important issues, such as the obligation to consent before data processing, ensuring important rights regarding confidentiality and needs, while addressing the responsibilities of personal data controllers. The regulation applies to both the public and private sectors, including civil society organizations (2).\nRegarding compliance with the Regulation during the Covid-19 pandemic, on the 21st of April 2020, the European Data Protection Board adopted Guidelines 4\/2020 on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, that established for the tracking apps not to involve the use of location data, but only proximity data (3).\nIn 2019, the National Authority received a total of 6193 complaints, intimation and notifications regarding security incidents, based on which 912 investigations were opened. As a result of the investigations carried out, 28 fines were applied in a total amount of 2,339,291.75 lei (meaning approximately 475,461.12 euros).

At that moment, the Law 109\/2007 will be repealed, the current draft law transposing the EU Directive, launched in public debate at the beginning of 2021 and that will be soon debated in the Romanian Parliament, will enter into force (3).

The new draft law transposing the EU Directive contains such a precise definition in Article 2, paragraph 8.\nLaw no. 109\/2007 specifies in Article 9 that in order to facilitate the access and search of documents provided in electronic and automatically processable format, public institutions must publish the documents to which the law applies also on the governmental open data portal -data.gov.ro-, together with metadata relevant, in compliance with the rules for its use. The portal was launched in 2013, and in 2015 the Guide for publishing Open Data was launched by the Prime Minister's Chancellery and the Coalition for Open Data (a coalition of civil society organizations).\nArt. 6-7 refer to the people or institutions interested in certain data may request them from the institution that has them, the response term is 20 days. The institution is obliged to respond to the applicant, the information may be made available to the applicant in full or in part; if only part of information will be sent, a motivation will be made on this decision. \nLaw no. 109\/2007 specifies in Article 6 that the requesters may specify in the application the format in which they wish the documents. To the extent that public institutions approve the re-use of the documents in their possession, they shall be made available to the applicant, in any pre-existing format or in any available language and, if possible and appropriate, in open and automatically processable formats, together with their metadata. Both formats and metadata should, as far as possible, comply with open format standards.

Asset declarations include: (1)\n- real estate and any valuable object in their property (cars, art, jewellery etc.);\n- any taxable income in the previous year and from this information the National Integrity Agency, in charge of the administrative control of conflicts of interest, or any interested person, can deduce all paid positions in the private sector held by the public official or the civil servant;\n- financial investments in companies;\n- loans to and from companies or other natural persons;\n- gifts, benefits and hospitality with a value over EUR 500, received from private sector entities. Moreover, according to Law no. 251\/2004, (2) public officials (including both elected officials and professional public servants) are not allowed to keep gifts received in their official position if their value is over EUR 200. Therefore, the declaration obligations cover as well gifts, benefits and hospitality received in any private context during the period they hold a public office.\nInterest declarations include:\n- shareholder interests in private companies;\n- membership positions in professional organisations or trade unions;\n- management positions in private companies or NGOs;\n- leadership positions in political parties;\n- contracts signed by the declarant, their spouse, parents or children as natural persons or as representatives of a company with any public institution.\nAlthough they do not cover all situations, the fact that declarations of assets and interests are filled in by all public officials (including both elected officials and professional public servants) and that they are publicly available to any citizen, journalist, NGO etc. makes the disclosure policy in Romania relatively strong. However, the number of declarations overwhelms the capacity of the National Integrity Agency to check them.

The regulation is legally binding on all 27 EU member states, which are responsible for establishing effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions and for implementing the regulation.(2) But, although this system exists in Romania, the problems regarding environmental protection, massive deforestation, illegal wood imports and exports continue to be major in our society, therefore the efficiency of this system still needs to be improved.\n(1) Transparency International Romania, Business Integrity Country Agenda Romania, 2019.\n(2) Checked Wood Statement on EUTR - https:\/\/lemncontrolat.ro\/eutr\/#mod-aplicare","evidence":[{"title":"Checked Wood Statement on EUTR","link":"https:\/\/lemncontrolat.ro\/eutr\/#mod-aplicare"}],"indicator_id":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL","indicator_name":"Use (CI): Corporate due diligence","indicator_name_medium":"Due dilligence uses of data","indicator_name_short":"Due dilligence uses of data","responses":[{"response_id":"30","response_text":"There is no evidence of such products or services in the country.","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.a.PRODUCTS","subquestion_id":"283","subquestion_text":"Is there evidence of this data being used in products\/services?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.GOV","subquestion_id":"284","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products and services being promoted to, or used by, government."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.CSO","subquestion_id":"285","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products\/services being promoted to, or used by, civil society"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"286","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products\/services being promoted to, or used by, the private sector."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.MEDIA","subquestion_id":"272","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products and services being promoted to, or used by, media."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e2.BO","subquestion_id":"287","subquestion_text":"There is evidence that at least one of the examples cited is making use of beneficial ownership data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"20","subquestion_text":"At least one of the examples identified describes using artificial Intelligence or machine learning to process data"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"21","subquestion_text":"There is evidence that these uses have had or are having meaningful positive impacts."}]},{"score":"13","justification":"In general, these data sets are used by journalists (1) and the non-governmental environment to uncover corruption or hidden links between people who have great influence at the state level.
