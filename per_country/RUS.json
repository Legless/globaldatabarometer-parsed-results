Each federal, regional, and local government bodies and government companies need to place on this website information about all contracts and tenders, with price more than 600 thousand rubles (~ $8200). They also can place here information about contracts and tenders under 600 thousand rubles. The data from all customers are updated every day. Now, this website has information about 45 million contracts. This portal also has the Open Data section and the FTP server (ftp.zakupki.gov.ru) with machine-readable data. Data about each contract has more than 100 fields. All government contracts are concluded in accordance with one of the three laws: 44-fz, 94-fz, 223-fz. The data about the contracts, which were concluded in accordance with 44-fz, have links to the full contract text (in pdf with signatures and stamps or in doc).\n\nRussian government procurement legislation is divided into several laws and other procurement regulations with varying degrees of detail. Federal law 44-FZ, which covers state budgetary and municipal expenditures, is primarily related to public procurement. The level of detail according to 44-FZ is quite high and makes it possible to assess the openness of the Russian contract system as very high. At the same time, procurement by state-owned enterprises in the Russian Federation is subject to less stringent disclosure requirements. Formally, this money does not belong to government spending, since it is not generated from taxpayers' funds. Such purchases are regulated by Federal Law 223-FZ. In fact, this amount of funds from state-owned enterprises is several times higher than the amount of funds under 44-FZ.\n\nCurrently, there is a discussion on toughening the requirements for 223-FZ and expanding the volume of disclosed information. At the same time, despite the common high level of openness in recent years, the protectionist measures of the federal government have been increasing, and some of the information is already limited and may be limited in the future.\n\n##Sources\n[1] https:\/\/zakupki.gov.ru\/","evidence":[{"title":"Unified Information System in the Field of Procurement of the Russian Federation","link":"https:\/\/zakupki.gov.ru"}],"indicator_id":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC","indicator_name":"Availability (PP): Public procurement data","indicator_name_medium":"Procurement data","indicator_name_short":"Public procurement","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e1.GOODS","subquestion_id":"150","subquestion_text":"Procurement related to goods and services is included."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e1.WORKS","subquestion_id":"151","subquestion_text":"Procurement related to public works is included."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e1.PLANNING","subquestion_id":"152","subquestion_text":"The planning phase is covered."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e1.TENDER","subquestion_id":"153","subquestion_text":"The tender stage is covered."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e1.AWARD","subquestion_id":"154","subquestion_text":"The award stage is covered."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e1.IMPLEMENTATION","subquestion_id":"155","subquestion_text":"The contract implementation stage is covered."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.PROCESSID","subquestion_id":"156","subquestion_text":"The data contains identifiers or other features that connect together data on each stage of a single procurement process."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.COMPANYID","subquestion_id":"157","subquestion_text":"The data contains names and unique identifiers for companies awarded contracts."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.DATES","subquestion_id":"158","subquestion_text":"The data contains start and end dates for tender processes and\/or contracts."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.VALUES","subquestion_id":"159","subquestion_text":"The data contains the value (cost) of each tender, award, or contract"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.SPENDLINK","subquestion_id":"160","subquestion_text":"The data contains, or can be linked to, information on spending against the contract."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.ITEMS","subquestion_id":"161","subquestion_text":"The data contains a description of the goods, services or works being procured."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.STANDARDS","subquestion_id":"22","subquestion_text":"The data is published according to one or more relevant data standards."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e2.DOCUMENTS","subquestion_id":"162","subquestion_text":"The data contains links to accessible tender, award, or contract documentation"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PROCUREMENT.OC.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

This law regulates the relations associated with the processing of personal data, which is carried out by state bodies, legal entities, and individuals. The purpose of the law is to ensure the protection of human and civil rights and freedoms in the processing of his personal data, including the protection of privacy rights, personal and family secrets. State bodies, the Bank of Russia, and local self-government bodies, within their powers, can adopt normative legal acts on certain issues pertaining to the processing of personal data. \n\nIn general, the processing of personal data requires the consent of the subject of personal data. Operators and other persons who have access to personal data are required to ensure the confidentiality of data, that is, not disclose to third parties or disseminate personal data without the consent of the personal data subject. Information on the subject of personal data must be deleted at any time from publicly available personal data sources at the request of the personal data subject or by a court or other authorized government agency. \n\nThe subject of personal data decides to provide his personal data and agrees to their processing in written or electronic form. This form should contain the following fields (full list in Article 9 of the law): name and surname, address, passport number of the personal data subject, name and surname or the name and address of the operator, the purpose of processing personal data, the list of personal data, method of withdrawal of consent, the signature of the subject.\n\nChapter 3 of the law contains a list of the rights of the subject of personal data, these include: the right of the subject of personal data to access his personal data; the rights of subjects of personal data when processing their personal data in order to promote goods, works, services on the market, and also for the purposes of political agitation; rights of subjects of personal data when making decisions on the basis of exclusively automated processing of their personal data; the right to appeal against the actions or omissions of the operator.\n\nChapter 4 of the law contains the duties of the operator, namely: the duties of the operator in the collection of personal data; measures to ensure that the operator performs the duties; measures to ensure the safety of personal data when processing them; the duties of the operator when referring to the subject of personal data; duties of the operator to eliminate violations of the legislation; notification of the processing of personal data; persons responsible for organizing the processing of personal data in organizations.\n\nChapter 5 of the law contains information on the authorized body for the protection of the rights of subjects of personal data and information on the responsibility for violating the requirements of the law.\n\nTo date, when a person completes any contracts or documents, for example, at a university, a hospital (including commercial laboratories), a government agency, etc., the \"Consent to the Processing of Personal Data\" form is additionally issued and must be completed. It is also filled in electronically, for example, when a person registers on the site, fills out a form, or draws up a ticket for the event. \n\nSince July 1, 2017, legislation in the field of personal data has been significantly tightened. Tightening affected the owners of sites and agencies, their developing and servicing. The minimal (incomplete) list of actions [2] of site owners in order to avoid fines and blocking consists of the following items:\n\n1. Under each form of data entry on sites and mobile applications (registration form, application, feedback, etc.), place the text \"By clicking on the button, I consent to the processing of personal data\", where the text \"consent to the processing of personal data \"is a link to the document itself. Instead of consent, you can use a single public offer, but it will need to register for what purposes, what data is being processed. In this case, it is necessary to store logs to prove to the authorized body that a particular user actually visited the site and left his personal data there.\n2. The site owner must approve the Policy on the processing of personal data by the order and place it in his office, on the site, and in the mobile application in the public domain.\n3. Transfer the site to the territory of the Russian Federation and learn from the technical support of the hosting provider or data center the address of the location of your server (find out right up to the building).\n4. Specify an email where an individual can apply to ensure that his personal data is deleted, blocked and where he can ask a question about personal data.\n5. The Agency and the site owner must submit a notice on the processing of personal data to the authorized body and, among other things, specify the addresses of the location of the personal data bases and the list of personal data contained therein.\n6. The Agency and the site owner, in case the agency has access to personal data from applications, databases or simply attracts customers, it is necessary to conclude an agreement on the security of personal data, which will indicate which personal data can be processed, for what purposes and what actions with them can be performed.\n\nThe legal requirement for the processing of personal data on servers located on the territory of Russia led to the blocking of the Linkedin and Slideshare in Russia [3].\n\nDespite the rather rigid and detailed legislation on personal data in Russia, there have been cases of leakage of the personal data of citizens. For example, in the summer of 2017, one of the users announced, that 17.7 thousand people were leaked from the Pension Fund of Russia in Moscow and the Moscow Region [4]. He received an e-mail from the pension fund, which contained a file with a table in which the user had to find a line with his name using the search and enter data. According to him, the employees of the pension fund did not consider that the filter of the Excel table allows to show all the lines.\n\nIn 2016, Infowatch (a company that deals with data security analytics) recorded that 128 million sensitive data records were compromised in Russia [5].\n\nIn addition, in accordance with Article 24 of the Russian Constitution, the collection, storage, use, and dissemination of information on a person's private life without his consent is not allowed. Bodies of state power and local self-government bodies, their officials are obliged to provide everyone with an opportunity to get acquainted with documents and materials directly affecting his rights and freedoms, unless otherwise provided by law.\n\n##Sources\n[1] https:\/\/rg.ru\/2006\/07\/29\/personaljnye-dannye-dok.html\n[2] http:\/\/www.cossa.ru\/152\/158773\/\n[3] http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-38014501\n[4] https:\/\/www.rbc.ru\/rbcfreenews\/5964e1059a7947032b1e6d7a\n[5] https:\/\/www.rbc.ru\/newspaper\/2017\/06\/08\/5937ddda9a79471a1683d2a2","evidence":[{"title":") Federal Law of July 27, 2006 N 152-FZ On Personal Data","link":"https:\/\/rg.ru\/2006\/07\/29\/personaljnye-dannye-dok.html"},{"title":"Article \"What you need to know about personal data in order not to pay a fine of 300,000 rubles\"","link":"http:\/\/www.cossa.ru\/152\/158773\/"},{"title":"LinkedIn blocked by Russian authorities","link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-38014501"},{"title":"Pension fund answered on messaged about data leak on 17 thousand people","link":"https:\/\/www.rbc.ru\/rbcfreenews\/5964e1059a7947032b1e6d7a"},{"title":"Data leakages in Russia","link":"increased by 100 times]https:\/\/www.rbc.ru\/newspaper\/2017\/06\/08\/5937ddda9a79471a1683d2a2"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Data protection","indicator_name_medium":"Data protection law","indicator_name_short":"Data protection law","responses":[{"response_id":"10","response_text":"A framework exists and has the force of law.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.CONSENT","subquestion_id":"257","subquestion_text":"The framework provides data subjects with rights of choice or consent."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.ACCESS_CORRECTION","subquestion_id":"216","subquestion_text":"The framework provides data subjects with rights to access and correct data about themselves."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.DATA_HOLDER_RESPONSIBILITY","subquestion_id":"215","subquestion_text":"The framework sets out clear responsibilities for data holders."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.REDRESS","subquestion_id":"214","subquestion_text":"The framework provides rights of redress"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.BREACH","subquestion_id":"213","subquestion_text":"The framework requires data controllers to notify an appropriate authority of data breaches."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e2.LOCATION","subquestion_id":"212","subquestion_text":"Frameworks explicitly cover the protection of location-related data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"211","subquestion_text":"The framework addresses algorithmic decision making."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.eb.COVIDEXCEPTIONS","subquestion_id":"209","subquestion_text":"Exceptions to the usual data protection framework have been made as part of the country's COVID-19 response."},{"response_id":"20","response_text":"The framework applies widely across all sectors (including public and private sector).","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.c.SECTOR_EXTENT","subquestion_id":"202","subquestion_text":"How broadly does this data protection framework apply?"},{"response_id":"17","response_text":"The framework assessed, or equivalent frameworks, apply across the whole country.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.c.GEOGRAPHIC_SCOPE","subquestion_id":"208","subquestion_text":"Does this framework apply across the whole country?"}]},{"score":"0","justification":"Russian is the official language in Russia.

Order of the Government of the Russian Federation of January 30, 2014 N 93-r (https:\/\/rg.ru\/2014\/02\/03\/koncepciya-site-dok.html). \n\nThe Order of the Government of the Russian Federation (9) approved the list of publicly available information, which must be disclosed in the form of open data. \n\nThe first systematic approach in the field of open data was implemented in 2012-2014, when the Concept of Open Data of the Russian Federation was adopted and implemented, laying down the institutional, legal and technological foundations of the open data system, including:\n\n- development of methodological and normative documentation;\n- adoption of the main instruments of certification, registration, and publication of open data;\n- the adoption of the first plans for the disclosure of state and municipal data;\n- the launch of the Open Data Portal of the Russian Federation (13).\n\nAccording to the road map 2015-2016:\n\n- In 2015-2016, federal executive bodies should, according to a certain schedule, disclose about 300 priority socially significant data sets, grouped into 27 thematic areas.\n- In 2015, all federal executive bodies should create sections of open data on their Internet resources and disclose priority sets (there were 80%).\n- Changes in legislation should be prepared in terms of referring activities in the field of open data to socially-oriented activities, subsidized by the government (the Federal Law \"On Personal Data\", \"On Commercial Organizations\");\n- Introduction of the presumption of general availability of primary statistical data (Federal Law \"On Official Statistical Accounting and the System of State Statistics in the Russian Federation\").\n\nThe Action Plan \"Open data of the Russian Federation\" for 2016-2017 (11) includes actions to develop methodological support in the field of open data, the development of regulatory legal support, the development of an open data infrastructure, access to open data, the formation of an open data ecosystem, the development of non-state institutions.\n\nReports on the implementation of the \"road map\" actions should be submitted by all federal executive bodies to the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia quarterly. In turn, the Ministry of Economic Development and Open Data Council should monitor the quality and timeliness of the implementation of the plan, and submit a consolidated report to the Governmental Commission. Also, the federal executive bodies annually fill out a form of self-examination of the level of development of mechanisms and directions of openness (14), one of the tools of which are the open data. The results of self-examinations are published on federal executive bodies website and the 'open data rating' is published on the Open Government website, f.e. the rating for 2015 (15).\n\nThe main working tool of the Open Data Project is the Methodological Recommendations for the publication of open data by state bodies and local self-government bodies, as well as technical requirements for the publication of open data (4). Follow the Methodical Recommendations, open data is information placed on the Internet in the form of systematized data organized in a format that ensures its automatic processing without prior modification by a person for the purposes of repeated, free and free use.\n\nFrom the Methodological Recommendations data owners (state and municipal employees) and their publishers (specialists of internal IT departments or companies involved on the basis of a contract) find out:\n\n- the requirements for the content of information resources;\n- the technical requirements for formats for the presentation of open data;\n- composition and principles of interaction of elements of the national open data infrastructure.\n\nThe Typical Conditions for the Use of Publicly Available Information Placed in the Information and Telecommunications Network \"Internet\" in the Form of Open Data (16) had been developed by the government.\n\n##Sources\n(1)
