These records will also be updated throughout the year if there are any changes. This requirement came about as a result of the Spanish Ministry of Justice Ministerial Order 319\/2018 (2) which requires Spanish non-listed companies to disclose their ultimate beneficial owners to the Mercantile Registry and keep said information updated. \n \nThe information contained in the Spanish register is only available to a limited number of entities upon request, such as, but not limited to the Prosecutor's Office, organs of the Judicial Power, Corps and Security Forces, the National Intelligence Center, the State Tax Administration Agency and also notaries and registrars, as stated is the Royal Decree 7\/2021, Fourth additional provision (3), the Obliged subjects identified in the Law 10\/2010, on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, Article 2 (4) and those that can prove their legitimate interest.\n\nThe Notaries Beneficial Ownership Dataset has express legal protection, Royal Decree 304\/2014, article 9.6 (5) which states \"For compliance with the obligation of identification and verification of identity of the real owner established in this article, the obliged subjects may access the database of real ownership of the General Council of Notaries after signing the corresponding formalization agreement\".\n\nAs aforementioned the dataset is not available online, but when companies submit their annual accounts to the Mercantile Registry, the company's national identification number must be included in the forms (6) therefore it could be thought that this information would also be included in the dataset to identify the said entity.\n\nIt could also be concluded that the following information would be included in the dataset when declaring beneficial ownership, in accordance with the Royal Decree 7\/2021, (3), which adds to the Regulation implementing Act 10\/2010(4):\n\nArticle 4 bis. Information of beneficial ownership of legal persons.\nAll natural persons who have the status of beneficial owners in accordance with the provisions of article 4, will have the obligation to immediately supply, from the moment they become aware of this fact, to the persons listed in section 3, their condition of beneficial owners, including the following identification data:\na) Name and surname.\nb) Date of birth.\nc) Type and number of identification document (in the case of Spanish nationals or residents in Spain, the document issued in Spain will always be included).\nd) Country of issuance of the identification document, in case the Spanish National Identity Document or the Spanish resident card is not used.\ne) Country of residence.\nf) Nationality.\ng) Criterion that qualifies that person as the beneficial owner.\nh) In the case of real ownership by direct or indirect ownership of shares or voting rights, percentage of participation, including, in the case of indirect ownership, information on the legal entities interposed and their participation in each of them.\ni) Those others that, through regulatory norm, can be determined\n\nIt also states that the obligated subjects of Law 10\/2010, (4) will have access to the current information contained in the Registry and so forth, but there is no mention of a publicly available register. \n\nThese provisions, added by Royal Decree 7\/2021, (3), will enter into force when its regulatory development is approved, as established in final provision 8.e) of the aforementioned royal decree.\n\nIn the Ministerial Order 319\/2018 (2) it also states that the models\/forms will be available in bilingual format with the co-official languages of the Autonomous Communities and that all the changes made to the Spanish (Castilian) model\/form have been made to the bilingual models\/forms, as well as the related XBRL taxonomy.\n \nThe same order contains three annexes that establish the annual accounts presentation models, and the format of digital deposits.

Similarly, it publishes a set of data referring to the bids received by the Autonomous Communities that have their own platforms. The stated information is also published on the Open Data Portal of the Ministry of Finance (2). \nWhile the Public Sector Procurement Platform is a step in the correct direction in the OIReScon (3) Supervision of Public Procurement in Spain Annual Report (4) that the information given by the regional platforms to the national platform, although it has this common nucleus, it is not homogeneous. On each regional platform, the data and fields are decided according to their own criteria, without there being a rule, instruction or common criterion, and the formats in which they are published are also different, in such a way that the aggregate treatment or exploitation of the data as a whole is prevented. While some regions are connected to the platform others are just hosted by the platform and their data is not usually offered in the same format.\n\nWhile no clear data standards that document agreements on representation, format, structuring, tagging, use, management... of data were found, Law 9\/2017, of November 8, on Public Sector Contracts (5), states that for the purposes of identifying the services that are the object of the contracts regulated in the said Law, the \u00abCommon Vocabulary of public contracts\u00bb will be used, which is that approved by Regulation (EC) No. 2195\/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 (6). \nThis regulation outlines that the Member States need to have a single reference system which uses the same description of goods in the official languages of the member states and the same corresponding alphanumeric code, thus making it possible to overcome the language barriers within Europe. Article 1 sets a single classification system applicable to public procurement, known as the 'Common Procurement Vocabulary' or 'CPV'.\n\n\n(1)\tProcurement Portal

Centrally this process can be completed through the national data portal (2) or the Electronic General Access Point (3). It should also be taken into consideration each ministry, regional area and larger towns have their own open data portal and many contain areas to request access to public sector information, while on one hand this seems useful, it can make it difficult or even confusing for citizens to request information as there is not one harmonised approach. \n\nIt should also be considered that even though the are many plans in process to support data re-use under Spanish law (1) the public entities that have received an access to information request have a certain time limit to respond. If they don't respond to the request in this timeframe, it is then understood to be denied under the premise of administrative silence, the person or entity that submitted the request is not informed of why this information cannot be openly published. This problem has been recently pointed out in the Transparency and Good Governance Council's activity report for the year 2020 (4). During 2020, 1704 claims were filed to the council, 55% of which were against state-level agencies or entities. According to the report, a high number of claims were filed against requests for access to public information being denied by administrative silence. 47% of the complaints processed by the Council in 2020 against state institutions were covered by this reason. \n\nRed.es (5) plays an essential role in the execution and deployment of plans envisaged for the digitization of Spain, it is a public entity attached to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation. It develops programs to promote the digital economy, innovation, entrepreneurship, training for young people and professionals and support for SMEs by promoting efficient and intensive use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).\n\nThere is an Agreement between red.es and the General State Administration (6) that has as its principal objective to carry out actions to promote the opening of information and public sector information re-use. In Spain they work with the administration on initiatives such as Aporta (7) organize different conferences and seminars (8) aimed at different information sectors and the re-use of their information, and they also organize the Aporta prize (9) which focuses on the re-use of public sector information. In each section the winner a given a certain amount of prize money that goes towards supporting their project and therefore the re-use of public sector information, the top ten and the winners from this year are published on datos.gob (10), each projects summary outlines what public sector information\/datasets are going to be used in its elaboration.\n\ndata.gob.es (11) is the platform managed by the Aporta Initiative. It is the meeting point between administrations, companies and citizens that are part of the Spanish open data ecosystem. This site not only gives access to many datasets but also tips on how to use data and how to share it, different guides, and information (12) can be found on how to use data, data standards and so on\u2026there is also a support area and a means to request the opening of information for re-use. The impact section of the website contains examples of applications and solutions (13) developed using, among others, data provided by public administrations. There is a space for up-and-coming events, interviews and notices related to open data and an interactive map (14) of initiatives launched to promote the re-use of public sector information in Spain, although these mainly consist of local, regional, and state open data portals.  \n\nThere are different meetings held each year between civil servants and data re-users, these are sometimes clearly documented on the public bodies website (15) but in general terms and clearly documented are those of the IV Open Government Plans (16) working groups (17), where civil servants work together with representatives from universities, the public and private sectors\u2026 to gain insight and solve problems related to open government in Spain. For example, in the communication and collaboration group they have created the open government observatory, which supports and highlights good practices being carried out to promote open government in Spain.\n\nDifferent education tools for primary, secondary and university courses can be found on the transparency website (18), there is a section that has guides about open government and MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) for \"Education in Open Government\" which is especially recommended for teachers with the main objective to train them to transfer the principles, experiences, and values of Open Government to Primary, and Secondary students. Also, on the national geographic centres' website (19) there is a section dedicated to the use of geographic information. \n\nLast year Spain created a data office (20) with its main functions being data management strategies design, the creation of data sharing spaces between companies, citizens and Public Administrations, as well as the development of secure access mechanisms to these data platforms, for public decision-making based on data or for business use.\n\n\n\n(1) Ley RISP http:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2013-12887 \n(2)  National data portal requests

Transparency and Accountability.\n2. Participation.\n3. Integrity.\n4. Awareness raising and Training.\nIt also includes a fifth block which features initiatives of the Autonomous Communities and the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the Local Entities.\n\nThe open government forum was created by the Order HFP \/ 134\/2018, of February 15, creating the Open Government Forum, article 1 (2), in order to institutionalize collaboration and strengthen permanent dialogue between Public Administrations and civil society in matters related to open government and in particular with the aim of promoting collaboration, transparency, participation and accountability. The Forum depends on the Secretary of State for Public Function. Its functions are outlined in article 2, among others is the creation and evaluation of Spain Open Government Plans. Article 3 goes on to establish the Composition of the Forum stating that it will be made up of the President and sixty-four members, thirty-two representing the Public Administrations and thirty-two representing civil society it also states that eight members will be representants from the General Administration with the rank of at least Deputy Director General, and that there will be one member for each of the Autonomous Regions and Cities and also four members, appointed by the FEMP in representation of the Entities of the Local Administration as well as members from different universities, associations and foundations among others.\nSingle additional provision goes on to state that the operation of the Open Government Forum will not involve an increase in public spending and will be served with the ordinary budgetary allocations. In no case may it suppose a net increase in the expenses of personnel at the service of the General State Administration.\nThe Purpose of the Agreement between the General State Administration and the public business entity Red.es, article 1 (3) is to jointly carry out actions to promote the opening of information and the re-use of public sector information, with special attention to the State Public Sector, and in coordination with the rest of the regional and local administrations in Spain, promoting the creation of new products and services, in collaboration with the private sector and civil society.

Therefore each region has their own law that governs topics such as open data, transparency, access to information and so on (2) and just about all of them have their own open data portal and \/ or transparency portal (3), giving them the capability to effectively manage their data and publish it if there are no restrictions by law. This seems to be ideal but there is not always one portal at a national level that brings all the information together in one dataset, there is datos.gob (4), the national open data portal but it publishes the information by region, for example if you want information about all the associations in Spain you have to locate this dataset in each region as is not available as one complete national dataset, making it arduous for reusers to obtain the overall national picture.   \n\nAn article published by datos.gob, Autonomous Regions Open Government and Public Data Strategies (5) gives an overview of the different commitments that the Regions have assumed related to accountability, the improvement of participation or open data and the re-use of public information, within the national Open Government Plan (6).\nOverall, most regions have training plans in place and are actively finding ways to collaborate the private sector and citizens in general.\n\nAlso, the Basque Country, Catalu\u00f1a region and the city of Madrid City have joined the open government partnership (7) and the Cities of Alcobendas, Zaragoza, Salamanca, Madrid, the Region of Castilla y Le\u00f3n the Principality of Asturias and the Generalitat's Valenciana and Catalan have adopted the open data charter (8).\nAn example of collaboration with the public sector can be found in the 9th Commitment of the Open Government Observatory (9) where all 17 regions have committed to working with Asedie to open various datasets of interest to the infomediary sector.\n\n(1)https:\/\/www.boe.es\/legislacion\/documentos\/ConstitucionINGLES.pdf\n(2)Ley 1\/2014, de 24 de junio, de Transparencia P\u00fablica de Andaluc\u00eda http:\/\/boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2014-7534 \nLey 8\/2015, de 25 de marzo, de Transparencia P\u00fablica y Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana de Arag\u00f3n\nhttp:\/\/boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-5332 \nLey del Principado de Asturias 8\/2018, de 14 de septiembre, de Transparencia, Buen Gobierno y Grupos de Inter\u00e9s.\nhttps:\/\/sede.asturias.es\/bopa\/2018\/09\/24\/2018-09529.pdf \nLey 4\/2011, de 31 de marzo, de la buena administraci\u00f3n y del buen gobierno de las Illes Balears\nhttp:\/\/www.boe.es\/boe\/dias\/2011\/04\/30\/pdfs\/BOE-A-2011-7709.pdf \nLey 12\/2014, de 26 de diciembre, de transparencia y de acceso a la informaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica - Canarias\nhttp:\/\/www.boe.es\/boe\/dias\/2015\/02\/06\/pdfs\/BOE-A-2015-1114.pdf \nLey 2\/2015, de 2 de abril, de Transparencia, Buen Gobierno y Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadana de la Comunitat Valenciana\n https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/pdf\/2015\/BOE-A-2015-4547-consolidado.pdf \nLey de Cantabria 1\/2018, de 21 de marzo, de Transparencia de la Actividad P\u00fablica.\nhttps:\/\/www.consejodetransparencia.es\/ct_Home\/dam\/jcr:0e4e0cf2-a40b-4e1e-9187-bc8d7d7e05eb\/Cantabria.pdf \nLey 3\/2015, de 4 de marzo, de transparencia y participaci\u00f3n ciudadana de Castilla y Le\u00f3n\nhttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/eli\/es-cl\/l\/2015\/03\/04\/3\/con \nLey 4\/2016, de 15 de diciembre, de Transparencia y Buen Gobierno de Castilla-La Mancha\nhttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2017-1373 \nLey 19\/2014, de 29 de diciembre, de transparencia, acceso a la informaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y buen gobierno. \u2013 Catalu\u00f1a \nhttp:\/\/www.boe.es\/boe\/dias\/2015\/01\/21\/pdfs\/BOE-A-2015-470.pdf \nLey 4\/2013, de 21 de mayo, de Gobierno Abierto de Extremadura\nhttp:\/\/www.boe.es\/boe\/dias\/2013\/06\/07\/pdfs\/BOE-A-2013-6050.pdf \nLey 1\/2016, de 18 de enero, de transparencia y buen gobierno \u2013 Galicia\nhttps:\/\/boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2016-3190 \nLey 3\/2014, de 11 de septiembre, de Transparencia y Buen Gobierno de La Rioja\nhttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2014-9898 \nLey 10\/2019 de 10 de abril, de Transparencia y de Participaci\u00f3n de la Comunidad de Madrid\nhttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2019-10102&p=20190422&tn=2 \nLey 12\/2014, de 16 de diciembre, de transparencia y participaci\u00f3n ciudadana de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia \nhttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/pdf\/2015\/BOE-A-2015-184-consolidado.pdf \nLey Foral 11\/2012 de la Transparencia y del Gobierno Abierto \u2013 Navarra \nhttp:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2012-9370 \nLey 2\/2016, de 7 de abril, de Instituciones Locales de Euskadi (T\u00edtulo VI.

of February 19, 2013, of the Secretary of State for Public Administrations, which approves the Technical Standard for Interoperability for the Reuse of information resources (2).\nThe technical standard for interoperability for the re-use of information resources (2) establishes common conditions on selection, identification, description, format, re-use conditions and making available documents and information resources prepared or held by the public sector, related to numerous areas of interest such as social, economic, legal, education and tourist information, and also information regarding companies, etc.\nThese conditions are intended to facilitate and guarantee the process of public information re-use, ensuring the persistence of the information, the use of formats, as well as the appropriate terms and conditions of use.\nTechnical Standard, Annex III (2) refers to the standards that metadata must meet when public sector information is cataloged and published. In addition to the name, description of the metadata and the type of data, it specifies if the metadata is mandatory and if it admits more than one metadata of the same type (as it could be in the case of descriptions in different languages). This Annex states that \"The semantic representation of metadata is based on the DCAT vocabulary\".\nThe process for the publication of Public Sector data is contained in the Resolution of February 19, 2013, of the Secretary of State for Public Administrations, which approves the Technical Standard for Interoperability for the Re-use of information resources (2), which includes the selection and identification processes of reusable information, the format of documents and resources, the applicable terms of use, the procedures for making the information available and the reusable public information catalogue.\nThis technical standard (2) also outlines standards for the publication and handling of Public Sector data. Annex II, for example, collects the URI Scheme that establishes a common identification mechanism for data that is publicly exposed, so that it can be referred to in a unique, reliable, and persistent way over time, a key requirement to facilitate its subsequent re-use. Annex III, related to Metadata, establishes that the semantic representation of metadata will be based on the DCAT vocabulary, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and that allows standardization in the definition of document catalogues and information resources. Annex VI on RDF template model for the definition of catalogues and records, establishes the Template Model for the description in RDF and XML for data, records and datasets.\nTherefore, we can consider that these Annexes establish the common technical standards and processes for the publication and management of Public Sector data.\nData.gob, the platform that organizes and manages the National Open Data Catalogue, published a Practical Manual to improve the quality of open data (3) in which it establishes that the quality attributes defined by the standard \"ISO \/ IEC 25012 Quality requirements and software product evaluation, Data quality model\"(4) and by the dimensions of open data quality defined by the Open Data Support initiative of the European Commission (5) should be taken into account.\nNo references were found relating to processes to request and integrate comments of external users with the aim of improving the quality of the data in the regulations and technical standards of interoperability it should be noted that the different Open Data Portals belonging to autonomous communities, local entities and public bodies, have request forms for the publication of new datasets and outline forms of contact.\nIn regards to data security the public electronic information system is established in Royal Decree 951\/2015 (6) that modifies of Royal Decree 3\/2010, of January 8, which regulates the National Security Scheme in the field of electronic Administration.

Law 37\/2007, of November 16, on the re-use of public sector information article 3.1 (2) states that the re-use of information from the Public Sector can be carried out by any natural or legal person.\nThese two articles show the government's ability to share data with other sectors, since any person or entity can make a request to access to public information, although it should be taken into consideration, as mentioned before in this section, that there are exemptions to this, for example the information held by the tax agency or the social security agency, as well as others, is not available for re-use. \nThe regulatory framework does not establish guidelines that regulate the exchange of data between other sectors, such as the Private Sector, with the State administration. These exchanges could be carried out within the framework of a public-private partnership, but there is no regulation in this regard. The European Commission is looking to facilitate the sharing of data held by companies to improve public services and guide policy decisions. The Commission has appointed independent experts with experience in the public and private sector within the area of B2G data sharing, as can be seen in the \"Guidance on private sector data sharing\" (4) section of the European Commission website.\nThe exchange of data within the Private Sector is not regulated in the current regulatory framework. These data exchanges, if they occur, would be done under private agreements between companies.\nThe current regulatory framework does not explicitly include references to the use of data for artificial intelligence, but the Spanish government has approved a National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (5). Without being a law, this strategy includes a series of measures related to the availability of open data, an essential component for the proper functioning and training of Artificial Intelligence systems.

The Spanish Constitution, article 18.4 (1), includes the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data as a fundamental right, which states that \"the law shall limit the use of information technology to guarantee the citizens personal and family privacy and the full exercise of their rights\".\n\nAs a member state of the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016\/679) (2) is applicable in Spain. This Regulation (hereinafter RGPD) is a European Union law that entered into force in 2016 and, after a two-year transition period, became directly applicable in all Member States of the Union European.\n\nIn addition, Spain has its own data protection law, organic law 3\/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (3) (hereinafter LOPDGDD).\n\nAccording to the analysis carried out by DLA Piper on the regulatory framework regarding privacy and data protection (4), Spain has a \"heavy\" regulatory framework.\n\nThe data protection regulatory framework establishes the right of the interested parties to give their consent to the processing of their personal data. The GDPR article 6.1 a) (2) establishes that the data processing will be lawful when the interested party gives their consent for one or more purposes and article 7 regulates the conditions for consent. In the LOPDGDD article 6 (3) the consent of the interested party is regulated.\n\nAlthough, as stated, the consent of the interested party is a basis of legality for the treatment of the data, it should be noted that the GDPR (2) establishes other bases of legality, such as legitimate interest or compliance with a legal obligation. Therefore, the interested parties must normally grant consent for the processing of their data, as long as the legality of the treatment is not one of the others mentioned in article 6 of the aforementioned regulation.\n\nThe existing regulatory framework for the protection of personal data includes the right of the interested parties to access and rectify their data. The GDPR article 15 (2) includes the right of access of the Interested Party, establishing that the interested party \"will have the right to obtain from the data controller confirmation of whether or not personal data concerning them are being processed and, in such case, the right of access to personal data and the following information: the purposes of the treatment; the categories of personal data in question ... \"\n\nThe LOPDGDD article 13 (3) reinforces the right of access establishing that \"the right of access of the affected party will be exercised in accordance with the provisions of article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679\".\n\nRegarding the right of rectification, the GDPR article 16 (2) establishes that the interested party has the right to have inaccurate personal data that concerns them rectified.\n\nIn the LOPDGDD article 14 (3), the right to rectification recognizes the exercise of this right contained in article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679.\nThe obligations and responsibilities of the data holders are mainly included in the GDPR Article 5.1 (2). Section b) establishes the obligation to limit the purpose \"personal data will be collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes\" and section c) complements this principle, establishing that \"personal data will be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.\" From these two sections, the responsibility of the data holders to limit access to personal data in accordance with its purpose.\n\nIn section d) it establishes that personal data will be \"exact and, if necessary, updated\". This responsibility to keep accurate and up-to-date information is also set out in the LOPDGDD article 4 (3) which establishes the accuracy of the data \"In accordance with article 5.1.d) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 the data will be exact and, if necessary, updated\".\n\nThe obligation to destroy or anonymize the data once the conservation period has elapsed is contained in GDPR article 5.1 section e) (2), which establishes limitation of the conservation period: \"maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of processing personal data\". In addition, article 32 of the same regulation, regarding the security of the treatment establishes that those responsible for the treatment will apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate and where appropriate, includes, among others, pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data ...\n\nThe principles relating to data transfers are found in articles 44-46 of the GDPR (2) and in article 40 of the LOPDGDD (3). The articles of the GDPR establish that transfers to a third country or organization may be made if they guarantee an adequate level of data protection, this obligation is also included in art. 40 of LOPDGDD (3), which establishes that data transfers will be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679.\n\nThe existing regulatory framework regulates the right of the interested parties to report and initiate proceedings against public and private organizations in cases where data protection regulations are not respected. In accordance with the provisions of articles 51 and 52 of the GDPR (2), in Spain there is an independent control authority: the Spanish Data Protection Agency, before which the interested parties have the right to file claims, as established in article 77 of the GDPR (2).\n\nThe Spanish Data Protection Agency is established as a competent and independent control body in the LOPDGDD article 44.1 (3). This same law regulates in Title VIII the procedures in the case of possible data protection regulation violations.\n\nThe GDPR articles 33 and 34 (2) establish the obligation for organizations (public and private) that act as data controllers to notify the competent Control Authority of personal data breaches when it is probable that they constitute a risk to the citizens' rights.\n\nThere are other regulatory provisions that require reporting security breaches to the competent control authority (Spanish Data Protection Agency in the case of Spain), such as that of Law 9\/2014, of May 9, General Telecommunications Article 41 (5) that obliges operators of electronic communications services available to the public to notify violations of personal data.\n\nThe LOPDGDD articles 73 and 74 (3) include as infractions the breach to notify the data protection authority of a personal data security violations in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR article 33 (2).\n\nThe Spanish Agency for Data Protection, the competent national authority, has prepared a guide for the notification of personal data breaches (6), which aims to guide those responsible for the processing of personal data in the fulfillment of their notification obligations.\n\nThe GDPR (2) seems to cover the protection of location-related data as it is considered to be personal data, as detailed in the GDPR, article 4.1. However, it should be mentioned that although location data is included in the definition of personal data, the said regulation does not include a definition of Location Data.\n\nThe GDPR article 22 (2), specifically addresses profiling and automated individual decision-making, stating that \"the data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her\"\nEDPB Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 (7) clarify the concepts of automated individual decision-making and profiling, and aid in the understanding of current regulations on this subject.\n\nExceptions to the usual data protection framework have not been made as part of the country's COVID-19 response. The GDPR Recital 46 (2) explicitly recognizes the legal basis for the lawful processing of personal data in exceptional cases, such as the control of epidemics and their spread. Health data is classified as special categories of data, prohibiting its treatment unless it can be covered by any of the exceptions included in article 9.2. of the said regulation.\n\nThe Spanish Data Protection Agency published a report on data processing in relation to COVID-19 (8), in which it specified that the processing of personal data in health emergency situations continues to be treated in accordance with the personal data protection regulation.\n\nDecree 43\/2021 (9), chapter III, on security of networks and information systems outlines the notification procedure of a cyber-incident and in article 9 the notification obligations provided to the Spanish Data Protection Agency.\n\nThe \"cookies\" and eprivacy laws should also be considered, Decree 13\/2012 of March 30, 2012, (10) reflecting the European Directive of 2009, modifies article 22 Law 34\/2002, article 22 on services of the information society and electronic commerce (LSSI) requires the users consent for \"cookies\" that store information on the user's equipment and allow access to it; devices that can facilitate web browsing but whose use can reveal aspects of the private sphere of users, making it important that users are adequately informed and have mechanisms that allow them to preserve their privacy.

But on the other hand, this same article indicates that the other languages may also be official in the Autonomous Regions in accordance with their respective Statutes. It is a constitutional provision that has been assumed with respect to Catalan, Valencian, Basque, Galician and Aranese.\nTaking into consideration the characteristic, where a high percentage of inhabitants reside in territories where more than one language is spoken, the General State Administration carries out its activity in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, promoting respect and protection of linguistic plurality Spanish.\nRoyal Decree 905\/2007, of July 6, which creates the Official Languages in the General State Administration Council and the Office for Official Languages, article 1(4), establishes the creation of a Council, which aims to achieve the compliance with the requirements derived from the existence of different official languages. Among its functions is to propose lines of action and objectives to be achieved by the different ministerial departments and other public entities in relation to the use of official languages.\nNo reference was found in the framework that mentioned a verification process that guarantees that the collection and publication of the data is being carried out in the different official languages, but it should be noted that the open portals in different Autonomous Regions in which there is a co-official language, the publication of the data is carried out in the official language of the region and in Castilian, thus complying with the provisions of the laws mentioned above.\n\n(1)\thttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565 Law 39\/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations\n(2)\thttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/diario_boe\/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2007-19814 Law 37\/2007, of November 16, on the re-use of public sector information\n(3)\thttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-1978-31229 Spanish Constitution \n(4)\thttps:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2007-13911 Royal Decree 905\/2007, of July 6, which creates the Official Languages in the General State Administration Council and the Office for Official Languages.","evidence":[{"title":"Law 39\/2015","link":"https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565"},{"title":"Law 37\/2007 RISP","link":"https:\/\/www.boe.es\/diario_boe\/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2007-19814"},{"title":"Spanish Constitution","link":"https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-1978-31229"},{"title":"Royal Decree 905\/2007","link":"https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2007-13911"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.LANG","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Language coverage & data","indicator_name_medium":"Language and data governance","indicator_name_short":"Language and data governance","responses":[{"response_id":"10","response_text":"A framework exists and has the force of law.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.LANG.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"77","response_text":"There is either a dedicated framework for language coverage related to data or a framework that includes specific provisions related to language coverage and data.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.LANG.a.FRAMEWORK","subquestion_id":"24","subquestion_text":"Where does this requirement exist?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.LANG.e.e1.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.LANG.e.e1.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"8","response_text":"They provide national coverage.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.LANG.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"18","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive, in terms of jurisdiction, is the coverage of the laws, regulations, policies, or guidance assessed for this question?"}]},{"score":"70","justification":"In Spain there is a broad legal framework that regulates the publication of Public Sector information in open data format. This framework for open government data is mainly composed of laws. \n\nIt is necessary to mention Law 19\/2013 on transparency, access to public information and good governance (1) Law 37\/2007 on re-use of public sector information (2), and its amendment Law 18\/2015 (3) the last two being implementations of EU law.\nIt should be noted that Law 37\/2007, first additional provision (2), establishes that the Government, at the proposal of the competent Ministries, will develop action plans and programs aimed at facilitating the re-use of public sector information to promote the digital content sectors growth, allowing for the establishment of collaboration mechanisms that are deemed pertinent for the achievement of said objective with other public entities. \n\nIn compliance with the aforementioned agreements, one has been signed between the General State Administration and the public business entity Red.es, to promote the opening and re-use of public sector information (4). The APORTA initiative names the set of actions that are developed within this framework which collect and articulate different action areas of the participating entities, with the aim to respond to the objectives and mandates contained in the different regulatory provisions listed in the preceding paragraphs. This Initiative has been mentioned as a good practice example in the Analytical Report 13 published by the European Data Portal (5).\n\nIn addition to these laws and initiatives, there is the fourth Spanish Open Government Plan (6), a policy that includes commitments and advances in the field of Open government, transparency, open data, and re-use. As stated in the Prologue of the document, Spain has \"a National Open Government Plan, to which not only the commitments of the General State Administration but also the initiatives of all the communities and cities with Statute of Autonomy as well as local entities, through the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces, have been incorporated. This national approach reflects the public administrations' firm commitment to open data, transparency, participation and integrity policies, to serve the citizens more effectively\". Therefore, it could be argued that there is a policy that is established for the different levels of the state administration. But here it is key to point out that in Spain despite the policies being national in nature, due to the political structure of the country, each region carries out the opening of public sector information following its own rules, which can at times cause a lack of harmonization and can also hinder the access to many datasets, for example, if only five of the 17 Autonomous regions have a certain dataset open, researchers, re-users or even the administration itself does not have a global vision of the said information but only a partial image.\n\nIn this regulatory framework the definition of Open Data in Law 37\/2007, Annex (2), open data is understood as \"data that anyone is free to use, re-use and redistribute, with the only limit, if necessary, the requirement of attribute the source or recognise authorship\". This definition coincides with the one established by the Open Data Handbook (7), however, it could be considered that the definition should explicitly contemplate the technical aspect of \"machine readability\" therefore it should be taken into account that this is contemplated in Law 37\/2007, article 5, (2) which establishes that the Administrations and public sector organizations will try, whenever possible and appropriate, to provide information in an open and machine-readable format.\n\nLaw 18\/2015, single article, number 7 (3), establishes that the Administrations and public sector bodies included within the scope of this Law, will promote the use of open licenses with the minimum possible restrictions on the re-use of information. Therefore, it could be understood that the use of open licenses is promoted, but with the allusion made to the \"minimum restrictions\" without actually specifying what those restrictions are, it cannot be understood that only restrictions are those outlined in the question \"attribution\" and \"share-alike\", and it would depend on the interpretation of each individual public body. \n\nLaw 37\/2007, article 5 (1) refers to the formats available for re-use, establishing that the Administrations and public sector bodies will provide their documents in any pre-existing format or language, but will also try, whenever possible and appropriate, provide them in an open and machine-readable format. As it mentions \"whenever possible and appropriate\" it shouldn't be contemplated that the \"framework requires\", but rather that the \"framework promotes\" these formats. Therefore, it is considered that the answer to this question is Partially. Publishing the data in a machine-readable format in this law, is not so much an obligation, but a recommendation.\n\nThe publication of the information that is collected must comply with the standards established by the Transparency Law (1) and that characterize open data: ease of interpretation, accessibility, quality, interoperability and possibility of reuse.\nIn addition, the Technical Standard for Interoperability for the Re-use of Information Resource (8) establishes common conditions on selection, identification, description, format, use conditions and making documents and information resources prepared or held by the public sector available. These conditions are intended to facilitate and guarantee the public information re-use process, ensuring the continuance of the information, and the application of formats, that favor reuse.\n\nThe IV Open Government Plan, Training and Awareness Axis (6) includes the commitment to develop the skills of public employees in the field of open government (commitment 7.3). The objective of this commitment involves carrying out a process of analysis, planning, execution, monitoring and evaluation of training activities aimed at the personnel of all Public Administrations. Actions that provide greater transparency, participation and accountability will be included in this process, and collaboration between the different public administrations and with other social agents will be promoted. This is complemented by the creation of the Open Government Forum Training Working Group.\n\n(1) https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2013-12887 Law 19\/2013, of December 9, on transparency, access to public information and good governance\n(2) https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2007-19814&p=20150710&tn=1 Law 37\/2007, of November 16, on re-use of public sector information\n(3) https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2015-7731 Law 18\/2015, of July 9, which modifies Law 37\/2007, of November 16, on re-use of public sector information \n(4) https:\/\/www.boe.es\/boe\/dias\/2019\/05\/06\/pdfs\/BOE-A-2019-6689.pdf Collaboration agreement between the General State Administration (Secretar\u00edas de Estado para el Avance Digital y de Funci\u00f3n P\u00fablica) and the public business entity Red.es, to promote the opening and re-use of public sector information\n(5)https:\/\/data.europa.eu\/sites\/default\/files\/analytical_report_13_open-data-best-practices-top-performers.pdf  Radu, Cosmina, 2020.

The same law in article 20 governs the resolution of the requests to access information, here it concludes that decisions issued can be appealed directly before the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction and in article 24 the claim process before the Transparency and Good Governance Council concludes that its resolutions will be published, after dissociation of the personal data they contain, by electronic means and in the terms established by regulation, once the interested parties have been notified.\n\nIt should also be noted that there are some regional laws that require the publication of this information.\n\n(1) Law 19\/2013 of Transparency, Public Access to Information and Good Governance https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2013-12887","evidence":[{"title":"Law 19\/2013 of Transparency, Public Access to Information and Good Governance","link":"https:\/\/www.boe.es\/buscar\/act.php?id=BOE-A-2013-12887"}],"indicator_id":"G.PI.RTI","indicator_name":"Governance (PI): RTI performance","indicator_name_medium":"RTI performance frameworks","indicator_name_short":"RTI performance frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"9","response_text":"There is no mention of data or the publication of data in relevant laws, policies, or guidance.","varname":"G.PI.RTI.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.NREQ","subquestion_id":"87","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding the number of requests submitted and processed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.RTIME","subquestion_id":"93","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding how long it took the relevant government agency or agencies to fill requests."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.EXEMPTREASONS","subquestion_id":"92","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding material withheld and the reasons for withholding it."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.APPEALS","subquestion_id":"91","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding appeals to RTI determinations and their results."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.DISAGG","subquestion_id":"90","subquestion_text":"The framework requires that information is linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e3.TIMELY","subquestion_id":"17","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require that data is regularly updated."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."}]},{"score":"0","justification":"Even though in Spain information about beneficial ownership, is collected under the legal framework mentioned in the above questions not all the collected information is available as open data. The Royal Decree-Law 7\/2021, on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing allows for the use of this information in compliance with the regulation it stipulates and in other cases access to beneficial ownership information can be gained through legitimate interest.\nRegarding other company information such as the accounts, all companies in Spain are obliged to register their business in the Spanish Mercantile register (2), this information is available to all for a nominal fee, with no log-in requirements but as it has a fee it cannot be strictly counted at open structured data, accessible yes but free of charge no.\nThis then brings as to the information published in the Official Gazette of the Mercantile Registry \"BORME\" (3), the BORME publishes all the acts that are registered in the different territorial Registries (such as the act of depositing annual accounts, date merger or split, etc ...) These legal acts are classified in blocks (one for each province). The blocks are ordered by the postal code of each province. These acts tend to be complete as they involve the intervention of a notary or a registrar to validate them. Although it needs to be noted that some valuable information is never available in the BORME such as account information and company identifiers. \nDue to this it is hard to be able to create products and services that use only open company data, as a great part of this data is not open or easily accessible, we do know that there are companies, for example those associated to ASEDIE (4) that produce these products and services using many different sources, some success stories can be found on Asedie's website (5), a great amount of the information is sourced by paying for it and then other information that is sourced can then only be used by entities that can prove legitimate interest.

Each year this General Directorate publishes an annual report on the activities and findings.\nSpain also has the Independent Office for Procurement Regulation and Supervision (OIReScon) (3) which was created by Law 9\/2017, of November 8, on Public Sector Contracts (4), with the purpose of ensuring the correct application of the legislation, promoting competition and combating illegalities, in relationship with public procurement. Each year it presents a report on the Supervision of Public Procurement in Spain that outlines the conclusions derived from the supervisory activity carried out by the competent administrations. The report includes, among other points, a list of the main breaches found and those responsible for them. The report is sent to the European Commission.\nThe opentender.eu website (6) provides comprehensive public procurement information at no cost in a user-friendly format to all stakeholders and its objectives are to increase market transparency, lower transaction costs, and facilitate government accountability. It has been established to contribute to achieving good value for money in public procurement, as well as to increase integrity throughout the public sector, the key entities that collaborate in the
