send two groups of representatives from Malaysia to participate in the Presidential Hackathon 2019 organized by the Taiwan Government in collaboration with the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP). One of the team developed a data-driven innovation with Artificial Intelligent features entitled \"Cartelogy\" to detect the existence of fraudulent offers in government procurement. Moreover, \"Cartelogy\" detects revenue leakages in government procurement by examining the patterns and relationships between companies, tenders and company owners and subsequently identifies risks of the existence of bid fraud and government procurement leakage during the evaluation and decision-making process of the appointed committee. Besides that, \"Cartelogy\" is a proactive and preventative tool to identify potential bid-rigging and corruption risks in public procurement at the tender stages before contracts are even awarded.  By developing and deploying a \"red flag\" mechanism\/tool to analyse, evaluate, detect potentially suspicious activities from the outset, respective decision makers (as well as oversight committees and relevant authorities) will be better equipped to make informed procurement evaluation and contract award decisions. This will reduce the probability of contracts being awarded to 'phantom', 'crony' or colluding companies and expose conflicts of interests or personal relationships between public officials and companies.
