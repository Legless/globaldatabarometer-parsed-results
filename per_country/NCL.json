Organic law n \u00b0 99-209 of March 19, 1999 sets the framework in which the development of the institution of New Caledonia will take place for twenty years. (2)\n\nThe Pacific Community (SPC) is an international government organisation that is owned and governed by its members states. New Caledonia is one of three Pacific island French associated territories which make up the 22 Pacific island countries and territories that govern the organisation. As an apolitical organisation, the SPC must remain neutral in matters relating to political governance within our member states. Given the politically sensitive time that New Caledonia is going through leading up to the referendum in December, SPC, as the commissioning organisation for the GDB survey in New Caledonia, has decided to refrain from responding to the questions under the Political Integrity module.\n\n\n\n\n#REFERENCE\n(1) https:\/\/www.elections-nc.fr\/histoire\/etapes-du-processus-institutionnel\n(2) 'The tages of the Instututional Process' https:\/\/gouv.nc\/gouvernement-et-institutions\/en-un-coup-doeil\n(3) Noumea Accord https:\/\/unterm.un.org\/UNTERM\/Display\/record\/UNHQ\/__Noumea_Accord\/9BCA7682FD6EEF7985257A85006D4AEB","evidence":[{"title":"Self-determination process on the accession of New Caledonia to full sovereignty","link":"https:\/\/www.elections-nc.fr\/histoire\/etapes-du-processus-institutionnel"},{"title":"New Caledonia institutional status","link":"https:\/\/gouv.nc\/gouvernement-et-institutions\/en-un-coup-doeil"}],"indicator_id":"U.PI.ACCOUNT","indicator_name":"Use (PI): Accountability uses of PI","indicator_name_medium":"Accountability uses of data","indicator_name_short":"Accountability uses of data","responses":[{"response_id":"47","response_text":"No evidence of actors or entities using this data for accountability purposes.","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"30","subquestion_text":"Is there evidence of this data being used for accountability purposes?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.CSO","subquestion_id":"29","subquestion_text":"Civil society organizations regularly use this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.MEDIA","subquestion_id":"32","subquestion_text":"The media regularly uses this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.ACADEMIA","subquestion_id":"33","subquestion_text":"Scholars or academic institutions regularly use this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"35","subquestion_text":"The private sector regularly uses this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"20","subquestion_text":"At least one of the examples identified describes using artificial Intelligence or machine learning to process data"}]},{"score":"11","justification":"The improvement of the procurement practice is one of the strategic axis of the government  : Axis 2 \"government procurement and contracts\".  \nThe legislation was adapted to ensure the improvement and civil servant was trained.
