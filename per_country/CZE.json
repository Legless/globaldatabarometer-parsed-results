This amendment came more than a year later than the deadline foreseen by the Directive.\n\nThe latter act established the Register of Beneficial Owners, which is online since 1st June 2021 (4). This Register contains information about beneficial owners of companies registered in the Czech Republic.\n\nSince June 2021:\nThe Register contains information about: Names, date of birth (month and year), nationality, country of residence, type of beneficial ownership.\n\nThe ID is a national identification number.\nNo explicit license is provided.
