The Cadastre is the set of basic data about the location, boundaries and extent of immovable property within the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria it also encompasses data on the right of ownership on immovable properties, data on the other real rights over immovable properties, data on the state borders, boundaries of administrative-territorial units, etc. (art. 2 of the CPRA). The Property Register should encompass the lots of the immovable properties including the acts recognizing or conveying right of ownership or establishing, conveying, modifying and terminating other real right over immovable properties, interdictions and mortgages over the latter, etc. The Cadastre (2) which provides data on land types and lots' boundaries and the Property Register (3) which includes all details on the ownership of land lots should be integrated via a unique identifier for each property lot under the CPRA. However, as a recent Court of Auditors audit report points out,(4) the existing Cadastre and Property Register are, so far, entirely matching data for only five (out of 266) municipalities. Some informal integration between the Cadastre and the Property Register is in place since 2009.(4) By January 2020 more than 16 million property lots have been created in the Property Register, however more than 11 million lots do not have a unique identifier and could not be directly linked to the Cadastre. (4) The report concludes that a Property Register as provided for by the CPRA is not yet established. Based on the data in the information system (of the current Property Register), the Registry Agency provides electronic services (i.e. data and excerpts of data), against payment, without ensuring the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the data. (4) Both data sets are not available as a whole, but excerpts from them - maps and data - are available for a fee.\n\n(1) \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044a\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044a\u0440 (Cadastre and Property Register Act (CPRA)).2000.
