The FOI Act charges the relevant commissioner with submitting an annual report to the relevant minister who in turn should table it in the Maltese parliament at the first available opportunity. The FOI Act demands that the report in question should state the number of FOI requests made, how many of them were accepted or rejected, the reasons for rejection, the average time taken to reply to requests, the number of complaints received (and other related information), the number of appeals lodged with the relevant tribunal, the number of various notices issued by the commissioner (1). Although the law stipulates an annual report detailing FOI requests, rejections, and otherwise, the last available report is dated 2018 and it does not include all the information required (2).\n1)\tFreedom of Information Act, Cap. 496, Art. 21. https:\/\/legislation.mt\/eli\/cap\/496\/eng\/pdf\n2)\tInformation and Data Protection Commissioner, 2018, Annual Report 2018. https:\/\/parlament.mt\/media\/105028\/04560.pdf.","evidence":[{"title":"Annual Report 2018","link":"https:\/\/parlament.mt\/media\/105028\/04560.pdf"},{"title":"FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT","link":"https:\/\/legislation.mt\/eli\/cap\/496\/eng\/pdf"},{"title":"Data protection chief: Freedom of Information law 'needs to be revised'","link":"https:\/\/timesofmalta.com\/articles\/view\/data-protection-chief-freedom-of-information-law-needs-to-be-revised.874396"}],"indicator_id":"G.PI.RTI","indicator_name":"Governance (PI): RTI performance","indicator_name_medium":"RTI performance frameworks","indicator_name_short":"RTI performance frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"42","response_text":"They are being drafted, or are not yet implemented.","varname":"G.PI.RTI.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"12","response_text":"Requirements to publish data are set out in binding policy, regulations, or law.","varname":"G.PI.RTI.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.NREQ","subquestion_id":"87","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding the number of requests submitted and processed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.RTIME","subquestion_id":"93","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding how long it took the relevant government agency or agencies to fill requests."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.EXEMPTREASONS","subquestion_id":"92","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding material withheld and the reasons for withholding it."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.APPEALS","subquestion_id":"91","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding appeals to RTI determinations and their results."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.DISAGG","subquestion_id":"90","subquestion_text":"The framework requires that information is linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e3.TIMELY","subquestion_id":"17","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require that data is regularly updated."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."},{"response_id":"21","response_text":"The framework covers the entire public sector.","varname":"G.PI.RTI.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"89","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive, in terms of jurisdiction, is the framework assessed for this question?
