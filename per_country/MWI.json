There are paper-based records recording land registration (3).

It only gives provisions on data sharing  when it is done from   government to  the other sector and vice versa. Further, at the moment there are no laws pertaining to artificial intelligence in the use of data. \n \nThe laws assessed are applicable to all government agencies however  they  do not  comprehensively address all the challenges that can occur due to data sharing.  For instance  section 71 of the ETCS act states that data can be  still processed without the consent of the data subject as long as it is in the interests of data subject or the  public. Such a provision  can be prone to abuse as data collecting   agencies  can capitalize on  this law to share data for  a purpose that it is not intended. So in as much as the act is prohibiting disclosure of personal data the exceptions to the same are too ambiguous and can manipulated  by  institution that have collected the data, thus defeating the purpose of the data being used for the public good.\n\nSources;\n1.

These laws neither  cover data protection matters   exclusively nor in sufficient detail. The laws touch on consent when  it comes to processing of  personal  data and provide redresses against public institutions that   breach data protection laws. However the laws do not specifically give any provisions addressing algorithmic decision making or cover the protection of location related data.\nThese absence of such provisions in the current framework indicate that   there is a need for a robust stand alone act solely for data protection especially considering that a lot of personal date is now being collected by a number of public  and private bodies without the necessary safeguards.\n\nThere is a  draft   data protection Bill which , once enacted, will empower section 21 of the Malawian constitution which has remained largely inoperative due to the lack of a specific law that details its framework for enforcement. In turn, this will help the government to fulfil its obligation on the protection of rights to privacy (3). However, certain limitations have been pointed out. While Clause 5 exempts processing of personal data, if done by individuals \"solely for personal, recreational or household purposes from the application of the law,\" (4) it does not define the terms \"personal,\" \"recreational\" or \"household\" purposes - this leaves room for abuse of privacy of the data subject. And Clause 14 provides for a penalty in case of breach of confidentiality of a fine of K5,000,000 (USD 6,289) and imprisonment for five years  - an express double punishment that may lead to miscarriage of justice (5). \n\nSources\n(1) Global Data Barometer Research Handbook, Pilot edition 2021\n(2) Kainja J, 'Data Protection Law on the Horizon in Malawi'', June 2020\n(3) Data Protection Law on the Horizon in Malawi https:\/\/cipesa.org\/2021\/06\/data-protection-law-on-the-horizon-in-malawi\/ \n(4) Analysis of the Draft Data Protection Bill 2021, CIPESA, May 2021 https:\/\/cipesa.org\/?wpfb_dl=446\n(4) Ibid\n(5) Ibid\n6) Access to Information Act\n7) Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act","evidence":[{"title":"Malawi Constitution","link":"https:\/\/2021-files.globaldatabarometer.org\/180\/sBiiedo-Malawi-constitution.pdf"},{"title":"Data Protection Law on the Horizon in Malawi","link":"https:\/\/cipesa.org\/2021\/06\/data-protection-law-on-the-horizon-in-malawi\/"},{"title":"Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act, 2016","link":"https:\/\/malawilii.org\/mw\/legislation\/act\/2016\/33"},{"title":"Analysis of the Malawi Draft Data Protection Bill","link":"https:\/\/cipesa.org\/?wpfb_dl=446"},{"title":"Access to Information Act","link":"https:\/\/2021-files.globaldatabarometer.org\/180\/wV9nR-8-num_act_2017_13%20%281%29.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Data protection","indicator_name_medium":"Data protection law","indicator_name_short":"Data protection law","responses":[{"response_id":"10","response_text":"A framework exists and has the force of law.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.CONSENT","subquestion_id":"257","subquestion_text":"The framework provides data subjects with rights of choice or consent."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.ACCESS_CORRECTION","subquestion_id":"216","subquestion_text":"The framework provides data subjects with rights to access and correct data about themselves."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.DATA_HOLDER_RESPONSIBILITY","subquestion_id":"215","subquestion_text":"The framework sets out clear responsibilities for data holders."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.REDRESS","subquestion_id":"214","subquestion_text":"The framework provides rights of redress"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e1.BREACH","subquestion_id":"213","subquestion_text":"The framework requires data controllers to notify an appropriate authority of data breaches."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e2.LOCATION","subquestion_id":"212","subquestion_text":"Frameworks explicitly cover the protection of location-related data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"211","subquestion_text":"The framework addresses algorithmic decision making."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.e.eb.COVIDEXCEPTIONS","subquestion_id":"209","subquestion_text":"Exceptions to the usual data protection framework have been made as part of the country's COVID-19 response."},{"response_id":"20","response_text":"The framework applies widely across all sectors (including public and private sector).","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DPL.c.SECTOR_EXTENT","subquestion_id":"202","subquestion_text":"How broadly does this data protection framework apply?"}]},{"score":"0","justification":"No laws have been found on the internet addressing the publications of legal framework in the   official languages  and in that regard, on the verification process or the issue of an official ensuring the timely collection  of the data.

The Challenge in Malawi is that there is no limit in terms of campaign spending, political parties can spend as they wish. During the 2019 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections evidence was all over as it was difficult to differentiate between a State Function and a Political Campaign Rally. A critical element of the campaign was the incumbent political party widespread and open distribution of cash and items. The presidential and Parliamentary Elections Act on the other hand under section 56 on campaign financing it is also silent in terms of open and transparent financing. As such the sour or manner in which political finances are sources remains a myth. The Polititical Parties Act of 2018 on the other hand accepts the various donations from private entities, thus by considering that:\nDonations with a monetary value of at least K1000 000 (US$1 400, 19 February 2019) from an individual donor and at least K2000 000 (US$2 800, 19 February 2019) from an organization must be declared to the Registrar within thirty days of receipt (Political Parties Act of 2018, 27 (2)(a)).\nFurthermore, aggregate donations donated within a month with a monetary value of at least K1000 000 from an individual and at least K2000 000 from an organisation need to be declared (Political Parties Act of 2018, 27 (2)(b)).\nAdditionally, persons and organisations who have donated to political parties have to declare to the registrar in cases where the donations exceed K1000 000 for individuals and K2000 000 for organisations (Political Parties Act of 2018, 27 (4)).\n\nOnly the President, Secretary-General or Treasurer-General may formally declare to party funding to the Registrar. Failure by donors or political parties to declare their assets will lead to the those being liable for a fine equal \"to the amount of the funds or the value of the assets not declared or in relation to which false information was given, and to imprisonment for two years\" (Political Parties Act of 2018, 27 (6)(a) and (b).\n\n1.
