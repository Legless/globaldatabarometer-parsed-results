The DATA Act requires agencies to submit open spending data to the Treasury Department in standard formats that support quality and to some extent international standards. USASpending provides an API, bulk data access, and data visualizations on key topics. Recently, because of the CARES Act legislation, all spending for COVID-19 data was tracked and provided on USASpending. (5) \n\nWhile the United States continues to make progress with the availability of their budget and spending data, GAO and agency inspectors general highlight that many agencies continue to fail to report required spending data, or report it with errors. (6) (7) There is great opportunity to build out the standard spending data 'object class' field to provide more transparency on government performance. While there is much public information, specific amendments to budgets or inconsistent spending is not structured and would take some research to assess. Unreported spending data is calculated using the difference in the total obligated amount from the Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (excluding financing accounts) and the total obligated amount reported by agencies to USAspending.gov in 'Account Breakdown by Program Activity & Object Class' data (also called 'File B' data, see the DAIMS data standards for more information).

(1) This law greatly resembles similar executive policies and codifies it with a few notable additions including defining public data assets as anything that would be made available under a Freedom of Information Act public records request and new requirements for Chief Data Officers and open data plans. The Open Government Data Act includes \"open standards\" as part of the definition of \"open government data\" but does not prescribe within the law particular standards to adhere to. The Office of Management and Budget has provided partial guidance on implementing this law with M-19-23 (2) and guidance on Resources.data.gov (3), including a standards catalog, but as noted by the Government Accountability Office is tardy on further guidance on how to implement this law.
