Another report highlights who hold the most properties among all high profile officials. \n\nHowever, those reports are more informative than holding the officials accountable merely for  the assets they have. Instead, the investigative reports which find wrongdoings of officials and hold them accountable usually make use of the data from land and companies registers, together with information revealed by whistleblowers. Therefore, the public integrity datasets do not take the full credit for government official's accountability. \n\nSources:\n\n(1) \u7279\u9996\u9ad8\u5b9812\u4eba\u662f\u99ac\u6703\u6703\u54e1 \u5289\u6c5f\u83ef\u674e\u5bb6\u8d85\u4efb\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8ecd\u9867\u554f, 2017, https:\/\/www.hkcnews.com\/article\/5844\/%E6%9E%97%E9%84%AD%E6%9C%88%E5%A8%A5-%E9%A6%AC%E6%9C%83-%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E6%9C%83%E8%AD%B0-5844\/%E7%89%B9%E9%A6%96%E9%AB%98%E5%AE%9812%E4%BA%BA%E6%98%AF%E9%A6%AC%E6%9C%83%E6%9C%83%E5%93%A1-%E5%8A%89%E6%B1%9F%E8%8F%AF%E6%9D%8E%E5%AE%B6%E8%B6%85%E4%BB%BB%E9%9D%92%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E8%BB%8D%E9%A1%A7%E5%95%8F?fbclid=IwAR1A2MxOSlgXJVxE5PYNCxdsdispliIHP-KICtFe3ejDUi9Fu-z91HaF6oo\n\n(2) \u653f\u5e9c\u66f4\u65b0\u5229\u76ca\u7533\u5831\u518a \u5f35\u5efa\u5b97\u96e2\u4efb\u5f8c \u912d\u82e5\u9a4a\u3001\u8076\u5fb7\u6b0a\u6210\u9ad8\u5b98\u300c\u6a13\u738b\u300d, 2021, https:\/\/www.thestandnews.com\/politics\/%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E5%88%A9%E7%9B%8A%E7%94%B3%E5%A0%B1%E5%86%8A-%E9%84%A7%E7%82%B3%E5%BC%B7%E6%93%81%E4%B8%80%E5%8D%97%E5%8D%80%E5%96%AE%E4%BD%8D-%E9%84%AD%E8%8B%A5%E9%A9%8A%E8%81%B6%E5%BE%B7%E6%AC%8A%E6%88%90%E9%AB%98%E5%AE%98%E6%A8%93%E7%8E%8B","evidence":[{"title":"\u7279\u9996\u9ad8\u5b9812\u4eba\u662f\u99ac\u6703\u6703\u54e1\u3000\u5289\u6c5f\u83ef\u674e\u5bb6\u8d85\u4efb\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8ecd\u9867\u554f","link":"https:\/\/www.hkcnews.com\/article\/5844\/%E6%9E%97%E9%84%AD%E6%9C%88%E5%A8%A5-%E9%A6%AC%E6%9C%83-%E8%A1%8C%E6%94%BF%E6%9C%83%E8%AD%B0-5844\/%E7%89%B9%E9%A6%96%E9%AB%98%E5%AE%9812%E4%BA%BA%E6%98%AF%E9%A6%AC%E6%9C%83%E6%9C%83%E5%93%A1-%E5%8A%89%E6%B1%9F%E8%8F%AF%E6%9D%8E%E5%AE%B6%E8%B6%85%E4%BB%BB%E9%9D%92%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E8%BB%8D%E9%A1%A7%E5%95%8F?fbclid=IwAR1A2MxOSlgXJVxE5PYNCxdsdispliIHP-KICtFe3ejDUi9Fu-z91HaF6oo"},{"title":"\u653f\u5e9c\u66f4\u65b0\u5229\u76ca\u7533\u5831\u518a\u3000\u5f35\u5efa\u5b97\u96e2\u4efb\u5f8c\u3000\u912d\u82e5\u9a4a\u3001\u8076\u5fb7\u6b0a\u6210\u9ad8\u5b98\u300c\u6a13\u738b\u300d","link":"https:\/\/www.thestandnews.com\/politics\/%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E5%88%A9%E7%9B%8A%E7%94%B3%E5%A0%B1%E5%86%8A-%E9%84%A7%E7%82%B3%E5%BC%B7%E6%93%81%E4%B8%80%E5%8D%97%E5%8D%80%E5%96%AE%E4%BD%8D-%E9%84%AD%E8%8B%A5%E9%A9%8A%E8%81%B6%E5%BE%B7%E6%AC%8A%E6%88%90%E9%AB%98%E5%AE%98%E6%A8%93%E7%8E%8B"}],"indicator_id":"U.PI.ACCOUNT","indicator_name":"Use (PI): Accountability uses of PI","indicator_name_medium":"Accountability uses of data","indicator_name_short":"Accountability uses of data","responses":[{"response_id":"46","response_text":"There are isolated cases of actors or entities using this kind of data for accountability purposes, though the source may not be open data.","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"30","subquestion_text":"Is there evidence of this data being used for accountability purposes?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.CSO","subquestion_id":"29","subquestion_text":"Civil society organizations regularly use this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.MEDIA","subquestion_id":"32","subquestion_text":"The media regularly uses this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.ACADEMIA","subquestion_id":"33","subquestion_text":"Scholars or academic institutions regularly use this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"35","subquestion_text":"The private sector regularly uses this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"20","subquestion_text":"At least one of the examples identified describes using artificial Intelligence or machine learning to process data"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"21","subquestion_text":"There is evidence that these uses have had or are having meaningful positive impacts."}]},{"score":"4","justification":"There was a case study of the procurement of fire service equipment by the government in 2010 aiming to improve the efficiency of procurement management  (1), but its methodology was mainly the qualitative analysis of the interviews of stakeholders, instead of quantitative analysis of historical procurement data. \n\nAnother example was in 2019, when a legislator asked the government for detailed data regarding the new policy to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups participate in tender exercises and create business opportunities (2).
