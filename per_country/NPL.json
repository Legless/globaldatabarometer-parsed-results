Being the Himalayan county, Nepal is in the high-risk zone due to climate change and there have been multiple numbers of research carried out to study the water resources [1], glaciers lakes [2], river basins [3], etc. Nepal Climate Change and Development portal [4] contains many such research resources related to climate change and vulnerabilities. Some of the major sources which contain the climate vulnerability information are the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology [5], which provided flood forecasting under the Flood Forecasting Division [6] and provides real-time data on rainfall and river watch. There is also a BIPAD portal [7], which informs the users about the details of an incident for both natural and non-natural hazards for response and for historical analysis of loss and damage, and Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal [8], which provide a summary on incidents like animal incidents, landslide, snakebite, and floods. Some of the mentioned portals do provide the data in an interactive format and mostly real-time.

But the parties' statutes are silent on the issue of disclosing their financial records to the broader public. According to the Transparency International Nepal [2] reports on the Transparency in Political Finance in Nepal [3], \"Dimension 6: Disclosure of information to the public (page 21)\" says that parties do not have incentives to declare donations, since the idea of contributing to political parties and individual candidates is not regarded positively, as they are viewed as a way of buying favors. On the other hand, there is no public pressure on parties to publish information on internal finance and become more transparent. Neither the state nor civil society has been successful in influencing the parties on internal governance rules which, still seem to be very much based on an autocratic hierarchy with little urge to move towards transparency and public participation.
