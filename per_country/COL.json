These viewers also have user manuals to facilitate the use of the information.\n#Sources:\n(1) https:\/\/www.dane.gov.co\/index.php\/estadisticas-por-tema\/demografia-y-poblacion\/nacimientos-y-defunciones\n(2) https:\/\/www.dane.gov.co\/files\/investigaciones\/poblacion\/pre_estadisticasvitales_Itrim_2021pr.pdf\n(3) https:\/\/www.dane.gov.co\/files\/investigaciones\/poblacion\/bt_estadisticasvitales_Itrim_2021pr.pdf\n(4) http:\/\/systema74.dane.gov.co\/bincol\/rpwebengine.exe\/portal?lang=esp","evidence":[{"title":"Estad\u00edsticas Vitales: Nacimientos y defunciones","link":"https:\/\/www.dane.gov.co\/index.php\/estadisticas-por-tema\/demografia-y-poblacion\/nacimientos-y-defunciones"},{"title":"Estad\u00edsticas Vitales - EEVV","link":"https:\/\/www.dane.gov.co\/files\/investigaciones\/poblacion\/pre_estadisticasvitales_Itrim_2021pr.pdf"},{"title":"Bolet\u00edn t\u00e9cnico Estad\u00edsticas Vitales (EEVV)","link":"https:\/\/www.dane.gov.co\/files\/investigaciones\/poblacion\/bt_estadisticasvitales_Itrim_2021pr.pdf"},{"title":"Visor datos Estad\u00edsticas vitales","link":"http:\/\/systema74.dane.gov.co\/bincol\/rpwebengine.exe\/portal?lang=esp"}],"indicator_id":"A.HEALTH.CRVS","indicator_name":"Availability (H): Vital statistics","indicator_name_medium":"Vital statistics","indicator_name_short":"Vital statistics","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e1.COMPLETENESS","subquestion_id":"125","subquestion_text":"The data includes information on data limitations, specifically on the completeness of vital statistics in different provinces, counties, or regions of the country."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e1.DEATH","subquestion_id":"126","subquestion_text":"Cause of death is standardized to the International Classification of Causes of Death (ICD) or a related, fully interoperable standard."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.MORTALITY","subquestion_id":"128","subquestion_text":"Mortality information includes data about age, sex and\/or gender, geographic location, and cause of death."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.CHILD","subquestion_id":"146","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about sex and\/or assigned gender of child, gestational age, and birth weight."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.LIVEBIRTH","subquestion_id":"42","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about live-birth order and interval between last and previous live births to mother."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.BIRTHDETAILS","subquestion_id":"127","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about place of occurrence, place of usual residence of mother, and month of occurrence."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.BIRTHREG","subquestion_id":"120","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about place of registration and month of registration."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.MATERNAL","subquestion_id":"119","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about age, educational attainment, and ethnic and\/or national group of mother."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.PATERNAL","subquestion_id":"147","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about age of father and place of usual residence."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.PRENATAL","subquestion_id":"133","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about site of delivery, attendant at birth, and month in which prenatal care began."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

Nor does it contemplate the exchange of information within the private sector.\n\n\n#Sources\nhttps:\/\/mintic.gov.co\/arquitecturati\/630\/w3-propertyvalue-8117.html\nhttp:\/\/lenguaje.mintic.gov.co\/sites\/default\/files\/archivos\/marco_de_interoperabilidad_para_gobierno_digital.pdf","evidence":[{"title":"Interoperability Framework for Digital Government","link":"http:\/\/lenguaje.mintic.gov.co\/sites\/default\/files\/archivos\/marco_de_interoperabilidad_para_gobierno_digital.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Data sharing frameworks","indicator_name_medium":"Data sharing frameworks","indicator_name_short":"Data sharing frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"10","response_text":"A framework exists and has the force of law.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.GOV_INTERNAL","subquestion_id":"218","subquestion_text":"The framework covers data sharing within government."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.GOV_OTHERS","subquestion_id":"219","subquestion_text":"The framework covers how government should share data with other sectors."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.OTHTOGOV","subquestion_id":"220","subquestion_text":"The framework covers data sharing from other sectors to government."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"221","subquestion_text":"The framework covers data sharing within the private sector."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"222","subquestion_text":"The framework explicitly focuses on artificial intelligence uses of data."},{"response_id":"39","response_text":"The framework assessed covers all government agencies, and many themes.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.c.DSF","subquestion_id":"223","subquestion_text":"How broad is the coverage of legal or policy frameworks for data sharing for the public good?"},{"response_id":"8","response_text":"They provide national coverage.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"18","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive, in terms of jurisdiction, is the coverage of the laws, regulations, policies, or guidance assessed for this question?"}]},{"score":"40","justification":"In Colombia, there is a legal framework regarding personal data implemented through Law 1581 of 2012 (1).

The regulations are dispersed and do not cover the entire public sector. In the first place, the second paragraph of article 144 of the Constitution establishes that the sessions of Congress must be public, and the exercise of lobbying shall be regulated by law (1). Chapter IV of Law 1474 of 2011 requires information of demarches in case of crime or disciplinary misconduct (2). Finally, Resolution MD-2348 of 2011 of the House of Representatives establishes a Public Registry of Lobbyists for that corporation (3).\n\nOf these laws, Resolution MD-2348 of 2011 provides information on the companies and individuals that have been registered in the Public Registry of Lobbyists for each term of the congressmen (four years), but this is reduced to name, address, and contact (4). In this regard, the registry on the page has the information for the period 2014-2018, so the data for the current period (2018-2022) or its legislatures to date are not available. On the other hand, this registry is limited to the House of Representatives, so it does not extend to the Senate to cover the legislative branch, but neither the executive branch (presidency, governorships, and mayors' offices) nor the judicial branch. \n\nThere have been repeated attempts to regulate the practice, since its informality has effects on its operation, irregularities, and sanctions (5). For the time being, current regulations on lobbying are considered lacking in \"integrity\" (6) or \"less ambitious model\" and restricted to one legislative chamber (compared to other countries) (7).\n\nCurrently, Bill 410\/21 (8) is underway, which seeks to regulate lobbying and create the Public Registry of Lobbyists (9). Its objective is to promote transparency and equal opportunities for participation in decision-making in public administration, as well as the promotion of interests in the branches of public power and State agencies (Article 1).\n\nUnlike Resolution MD-2348 of 2011, the Draft Law concerns the three branches of public power (legislative, executive, and judicial), control bodies, autonomous and independent agencies, and the Armed Forces (Article 3). In addition, it stipulates a minimum level of disclosure of information: identification; interest promoted, defended, or represented; lobbying client; meetings and travel information of authorities (Article 2). \n\nFinally, it provides consultation and provision for free of information from the Public Registry of Lobbyists, which, in addition to the lobbyist's data, includes his or her lobbying activities and record of relations with the authorities (Article 5).\n\n## Sources\n(1) Political Constitution of Colombia.

In fact, there are not official open government datasets for this, but especially a federated database con the whole information. As an example, the open data portal of the Government has some datasets regarding due diligence (e.g., a dataset of dismissed proponents) provided by a chamber of commerce, yet not by all of these (1).\n\nDue diligence is carried out through the validation and cross of both international restrictive lists, sanction lists, and public registry databases (2). By the way, in Colombia, there is no regulatory framework on the lists and databases that must be consulted (3). However, the management of due diligence and the submission of Suspicious Transaction Reports to the Financial Information and Analysis Unit (UIAF) is mandatory (3).\n\nInitially, Due Diligence was implemented in the financial sector through the Organic Statute of the Financial System of the Financial Superintendence. Afterward, it was extended to other sectors with LAFT (i.e., Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism) risks (4).\n\nRegarding national lists and public registry databases, due diligence services work with judicial records (Police) (5), fiscal records (Comptroller General) (6), disciplinary and contractual records plus the above (Attorney General's Office) (7), State Debtors Bulletin (General Accounting Office of the Nation) (8), the sanction resolutions declaring a fictitious supplier (from the National Tax and Customs Directorate) (9), among others (3).\n\nThe queries are performed with info such as identity card, tax identification number (NIT), company name, etc. The information provided by those entities is public and free of charge, but it is dispersed and decentralized according to the entity that produces it.
