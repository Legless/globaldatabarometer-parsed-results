While the old system was still in place, the contracting authorities had the right to decide to carry out electronically small value procurement through the new system. A year and a half later, in October 2018, the new electronic system became mandatory for conducting procurement, despite a number of technical shortcomings, including the\nlimitation to only two of the procedures provided for in the Public Procurement Law (PPL), carried out through electronic auctions,\nwith price as the only award criterion.\nThe effort has nevertheless continued to improve the system so that it would cover the entire procurement\ncycle, from planning to contract management, allowing the contracting authorities to conduct any\nprocurement activity or procedure regulated by the PPL.

(1)\n\n\nThe open data initiative is an important part of the OGP National Action Plan of the Government of Moldova. The latest National Action Plan for Open Government (2018-2019) includes a commitment about increasing access to information and use of open data. This commitment includes activities on both access to information and open data. Ensuring access to information and promoting the use of open data by citizens, publishing open data on the governmental portal http:\/\/www.date.gov.md, following the open data standards are some of the milestones included.(2)\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that there is an active open data initiative with a defined action plan and strategy.
