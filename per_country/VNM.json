Therefore, even though the government has been pushing hard on information transparency and publication, data on performance of FOI is hardly provided. Many localities reported not having received any request, which also indicates that the public awareness on right of access to information is low. But surely, this performance data should be available internally, if citizens submit any request at all.\nLaw on access to information,104\/2016\/QH13, https:\/\/www.rti-rating.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/Vietnam.pdf, implies collection of data on the performance of FOI - government agencies have to make annual reports on this data to submit to relevant authorities for supervision. But there is no requirement for publishing data on performance of right to information. However, in practice, government agencies at provincial levels or ministerial level publish this information as news at their website. \nThere is no publication of data on performance of FOI, but there is published data on performance of government responses to public complaints. \nFor more information, please refer to Law on access to information,104\/2016\/QH13:\nArticle 13. Supervising the implementation of the right to access to information\n1. The National Assembly shall conduct supreme supervision to ensure the implementation of the right to access to information of citizens.\n2. People's Councils shall conduct supervision to ensure the implementation of the right to access to information of citizens at localities; reviewing annual reports of People's Committees at the same level on the implementation of the right to access to information of citizens at the localities.\n3. Vietnam Fatherland Front and its member organizations are responsible for social supervision of the implementation of citizen's right to access to information\nArticle 34.l: Responsibilities of agencies providing information - l) Reporting to competent agencies on the status of ensuring the right to access to information of citizens at the agencies upon request\nArticle 35. Responsibilities of the Government, ministries, provincial People's Committees in ensuring the right to access to information \u0111) Inspecting, supervising compliance of the laws and handling violation of the laws on access to information;\nIn Vietnam, the government seems more eager to publish data on government responses to public complaints.","evidence":[],"indicator_id":"G.PI.RTI","indicator_name":"Governance (PI): RTI performance","indicator_name_medium":"RTI performance frameworks","indicator_name_short":"RTI performance frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"7","response_text":"They exist and are operational.","varname":"G.PI.RTI.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"9","response_text":"There is no mention of data or the publication of data in relevant laws, policies, or guidance.","varname":"G.PI.RTI.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.NREQ","subquestion_id":"87","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding the number of requests submitted and processed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.RTIME","subquestion_id":"93","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding how long it took the relevant government agency or agencies to fill requests."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.EXEMPTREASONS","subquestion_id":"92","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding material withheld and the reasons for withholding it."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.APPEALS","subquestion_id":"91","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of data regarding appeals to RTI determinations and their results."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e1.DISAGG","subquestion_id":"90","subquestion_text":"The framework requires that information is linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e3.TIMELY","subquestion_id":"17","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require that data is regularly updated."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.RTI.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."},{"response_id":"21","response_text":"The framework covers the entire public sector.","varname":"G.PI.RTI.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"89","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive, in terms of jurisdiction, is the framework assessed for this question?
