This results in a relatively fragmented and difficult to navigate environment to find information on consultations. As there are no requirement regarding what exactly is to be published or who is to be consulted, the data available varies from Ministries to Ministries. Generally, the comments are published but do not necessarily require action and\/or response from the Ministry in charge. \nThe data covered here concerns only the federal government and its activities. Individual states may have more developed frameworks and databases on public consultations.\n\nSOURCES: \n(1) Joint Rules of Procedure of the Federal Ministries (GGO), 2020.

However, this does not mean that there was no activities or talks about open data in Germany before this date. In 2013, Germany signed the Open Data Charter of the G8 and work started on what is now called the first Open Data law (EGovG, 2017). (1) (2) This law sets up the first legal frame for open data and has been since then accompanied to data protection laws, freedom of information laws, etc. (see governance section for more details on the legal framework). The initiative on open data is currently active and the German government launched in January 2021 a 'Data strategy' (3) that was followed in July 2021 by an 'Open Data strategy' (4). Both strategies count numerous measures to continue the improvement of open data in Germany. \nBoth strategies cover the entirety of Germany. However, some states may have their own strategy for open data that may differ slightly (while maintaining a focus on the four pillars of open data). \nProgressively, institutions were put in place to support this process at the federal level, such as the CCOD that provides support to public administration. It is also worth noting the existence of the IT planungsrat (IT planning council). The IT Planning Council acts as a central political steering body between the federal and state governments on issues relating to information technology and the digitisation of administrative services. All the initiatives related to Open Data fall under the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior, BMI.\n\nSOURCES: \n(1) The Federal Government's National Action Plan to implement the G8 Open Data Charter, 2014.

Around this law, there are several agencies and public administrations dealing with open data, such as the data portal DataGov.de, the competence center, the IT planning council. Each of these agencies has different responsibilities and produces guidelines to guide states that produce and publish data. \n\nIn Germany, each state has a data agency and may have its own open data laws and open data portal. DataGov.de is the centralised data portal of Germany. The basis for governing the federal portal DataGov.de is laid down in an administrative agreement that has been signed by 13 out of 16 states (2). \n\nThe Competence Centre on Open Data (CCOD) supports public authorities in implementing the open data framework. The CCOD is the contact point at federal level for states. It provides guidance and produced a handbook on Open Data (3).\n\nThe IT planning council (4) deals with technical IT issues, such as format. It decided to use the DCAT-AP as formal standard for open data portal starting in July 2018. \n\nThe EgovG (1) releases data providers from the obligations to check the data for accuracy, completeness, and plausability before publication. The legal framework focuses on the publication of raw data, hence it has not undergone a quality check yet. Available guidelines emphasize that despite the absence of obligation for quality check, data publishers should pay attention to data quality (3).\n\nSOURCES: \n(1) E-Government-Gesetz vom 25.
