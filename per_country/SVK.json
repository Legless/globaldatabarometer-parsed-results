Obligation to register BOs rises for companies that receive public funding or conduct business with the government which use public resources in lump sums of EUR 100 000 or more, or EUR 250 000 or more in a calendar year for recurrent operations. (4), (5)\nThe register allows full open data access via API or offers a search function to users without the need for coding. Simple search offers names of BOs and identifying company information, with more details about BOs available via PDF downloads.\n\nThis register meant a significant step forward in the access to information about BOs in Slovakia and has led to several investigations, including the wealth of the Czech prime minister Babis in Slovakia.(6) \nHowever, according to an analysis performed by Transparency International Slovakia, the BO data in the RVPS register contained a considerable amount of mistakes. The organisation also recommended improving the ability to download the data in bulk or partially for people without API skills.
