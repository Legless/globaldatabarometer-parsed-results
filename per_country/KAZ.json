One is the law on money laundering (1), where there is a definition of a beneficial owner provided. The definition applies to all companies throughout the country. However, the law does not regulate the publication and transparency of the list of beneficial owners. According to Article 77 of the Code on Subsoil Use (2), information on the owners of mining companies should be publicly available. This rule emerged as a result of NGO advocacy on EITI and the government recognized the importance of beneficial ownership transparency. However, the rule has limited capacity.\u00a0\n\nIn June 2019, the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development disclosed, for the first time, beneficial ownership data on its website (3).
