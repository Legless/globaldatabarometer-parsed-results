The Pilot Programme on Climate Resilience (PPCR) is one of the programmes under the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) of the Climate Investment Fund (CIF).\n\nIt is designed to lead and demonstrate ways on how to integrate climate risk and resilience into policies and planning in developing countries. The PPCRs are country-led and will enable mentor countries to transform specific investment plans and programmes to address climate risks and vulnerabilities by building relevant country strategies and research.\n\nThe implementation of the PPCR at the national level, known as the Strategic Programme for Climate Resilience (SPCR), aims to generate knowledge, learning and lessons to inform the future scaling up of PPCR interventions across the country and build the resilience of the national economy as well as all sectors and communities to the risks posed by increased climate variability.\n\nSources\n(1) https:\/\/www.mta.gov.mz\/mudancas-climaticas\/adaptacao-e-mitigacao\/\n(2) https:\/\/www.mta.gov.mz\/ambiente\/\n(3) https:\/\/www.mta.gov.mz\/mudancas-climaticas\/mudancas-climaticas\/) does not present any kind of data\n(4) https:\/\/www.mta.gov.mz\/ambiente\/","evidence":[{"title":"Mozambique: Climate Information by City","link":"https:\/\/www.iamat.org\/country\/mozambique\/climate-data"},{"title":"Mozambique Climat","link":"https:\/\/fr.climate-data.org\/afrique\/mozambique-88\/"},{"title":"Ministry of Land and Environment","link":"https:\/\/www.mta.gov.mz\/"}],"indicator_id":"A.CLIMATE.EMI","indicator_name":"Availability (CA): Emission","indicator_name_medium":"Emissions data","indicator_name_short":"Emissions","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.NATDETAIL","subquestion_id":"106","subquestion_text":"Nationally published data includes detailed information on greenhouse gas emissions and targets reported to the UNFCCC."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.SOURCES","subquestion_id":"104","subquestion_text":"Data contains detailed information on sources of greenhouse gas emissions."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.LANDUSE","subquestion_id":"97","subquestion_text":"Emissions data includes, or site where emissions data is made available links to, details of land use effects on emissions."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e1.EID","subquestion_id":"103","subquestion_text":"The dataset contains unique identifiers for greenhouse gas emissions that allow easy assessment across inventories, reduction commitments, and sources."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.EMI.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.
