Under Liberia's Association Law, companies are required to file reports of the names and addresses of their registered shareholders. The law gives other shareholders the right to inspect this information. It does not require the companies to make this information available outside their offices.\n\nCompanies registered under the Liberian Corporate Registry are not even subject to Liberia laws. On the Liberia Corporate Registry's website it clearly states that corporations registered by them have \"No annual reporting or audits\" obligations. This declaration on the Registry's website seems to run contrary to the regulation issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2019.
