The inventory is the key source of evidence on New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions trends. New Zealand's inventory data are used for both international and domestic reporting(1). The Inventory measures New Zealand's progress against obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The Inventory adheres to the UNFCCC reporting guidelines and the international methodology guidelines set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Inventory is the official source of New Zealand's emissions and removals data and is reported annually to the UNFCCC. It is also the basis by which progress towards targets is determined. Data is available from 1990, in line with international reporting requirements. Emissions and removals projections are also produced and reported every two years(2). The Inventory contains information about sectors (Agriculture, Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Waste, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Other (Tokelau), as well as Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry under the Kyoto Protocol (KP-LULUCF)(3). It contains detailed information on sources of greenhouse gas emissions and details of land use effects on emissions(4). Since the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019 came into force, however, NZ has also begun tracking progress against our domestic targets(5). New Zealand's Interactive Emissions Tracker summarises the data from the Inventory(6)\n\n1. NZ Ministry for the Environment. May 2021.

In July 2020, Transparency International ran a webinar on the issue(4). Over this time, COVID 19 intervened, followed by the October 2020 general election. In May 2021, the Institute of Directors reported that this work has been combined with another MBIE initiative considering the introduction of director identification numbers(5).

LINZ offers users an open search of the restricted Landonline database to find a title, instrument or survey. A copy of the record which includes the name of the property owner can be purchased for $5(4).\n\nThe LDS NZ Property titles list includes M\u0101ori land. Note that a total of 27,000 total M\u0101ori land blocks are registered with LINZ in Landonline, representing about 99 percent of the total inventory of M\u0101ori freehold land. M\u0101ori Land Online is the free online register of M\u0101ori land titles held by the M\u0101ori Land Court, and any registered title held by LINZ(5). It provides a snapshot of current ownership, trustee, memorial and block information for land that falls within the jurisdiction of the M\u0101ori Land Court under Te Ture Whenua M\u0101ori Act 1993 and other legislation. Information on land concessions and\/or leases is in the LDS NZ Title Memorials List(6). The official site is at the M\u0101ori Land Court(7). The LDS data can be downloaded in bulk and via an API. M\u0101ori Land Online data is made available in 1 of 2 spatial formats, a shapefile and a geodatabase, is ESRI compatible and maybe downloaded and imported into mapping applications. The Central Record of State Land prototype uses information that is held by all government agencies, and is also available via an official information act request(8).

Government policy supports and encourages government data re-use through the Reusable Principle of the government's Cabinet mandated NZ Data and Information Management Principles(2).  The NZ government's open data action plan 2017-2020 aimed \"to develop an open data enabling environment and accelerate the use and reuse of open government data so that NZ is maximising the value of open data\"(3).\n\nGovHacks were held in 2019(4) and 2020(5). The NZ government's primary role was to ensure that its data was reusable and guide participants to that data. Central government has supported open government data reuse since 2010 when it released the NZ Government Open Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL)(6). The Open data showcase on the Open government data portal sets out case studies of reuse of its data(7). The Government Open Data Portal promotes the benefits of open data use by the private sector, start-ups, NGOs and the not for profit sector(8). The NZ GovTech Accelerator programme, led by Creative HQ over the last three years, included a data challenge project in 2020(9). The 2020 independent report on the closure of the open data programme listed the increased subscription and participation numbers in meetups around NZ over 2017-2020(10). \n\n1. NZ Government. 2019.

These codes modify the operation of the Privacy Act and set rules for specific industries, organisations, or types of personal information(4).\nComplaints, investigations, and proceedings are set out in Part 5 (5). The Privacy Act does not cover location-related data, other than allowing law enforcement authorities to reveal location for vehicles of interest, missing persons (for fines enforcement), and records of prisoners(6). Privacy, ethics and human rights are safeguarded in the government's voluntary Algorithm Charter for Aotearoa New Zealand to which 26 government agencies have signed up(7). This Charter complements the 2018 Principles for the safe and effective use of data and analytics(8). No impact assessment of the Charter has been completed in this survey period. The Privacy Commissioner has published a very extensive range of publications describing the Privacy Act 2020(9). On 6 July 2021 the Government announced it would implement a new legislative framework for a consumer data right following public consultation on a 2020 Discussion Paper(10), (11). New Zealand Geospatial Research and Development Priorities and Opportunities 2016 \u2013 2020 states that obstacles to increasing the uptake and use of geospatial information include concerns about data privacy, data ownership, the liability for the use of data and data confidentiality(12).\n\n1.
