In the case of asset declarations, this is only searchable by the national identification number (ID)(1), which only leads to PDF documents where the relevant data, assets and liabilities, must be manually extracted. Hence, interoperability across different political integrity datasets is minimal and when it is possible, it requires a high degree of data wrangling.\n\nInteroperability with other relevant datasets such as public procurement, land, company information, and public finance is similarly limited in Paraguay. Land data is not open; company information has only two variables (name and VAT identifier or RUC), and public finance cannot be directly matched to procurement data (2). It is this last dataset, procurement, which has the most interoperable fields because government contractors and providers must register with their VAT identifier, their legal address, and their national ID.

This is how for the first time, years of public employees assets and liabilities sworn statements were published (1). This is also what motivated many citizens to monitor public procurement cases involving the Healthcare Ministry due to the spike in medicine prices. Key civil servants from said ministry had to resign after irregularities were exposed in procurement processes (2). Two major government providers for the Healthcare Ministry were suspended for the same reason (3). These situations were also largely due to organised civil society and the tools they developed (4)(5). These tools allowed to show how, in a period of a few years, certain politicians increased their assets in over 1000% (6). In another case, one of the richest municipalities did not invest for an entire year in education infrastructure even though about USD 2 million were available (7).
