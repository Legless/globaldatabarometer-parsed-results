Therefore, we do not have data available online for our study period.\nData on information regarding indigenous people or marginalized populations, land tenure involving freehold land, urban and rural land tenure, as well as other relevant forms of land tenure, information on land concessions and\/or leases, information on land transactions and sale-values, information about the rights held over the land (freehold, lease, etc.) are not available (2).\nSources :\n(1)https:\/\/www.commerce.gov.bf\/fileadmin\/user_upload\/storage\/fichiers\/Brochure_Loi_RAF_034-2012_AN__BD.pdf\n(2)http:\/\/www.cns.bf\/IMG\/pdf\/annuaire_statistique_2016.pdf\n(3)http:\/\/cns.bf\/spip.php?id_rubrique=109&page=publdetails","evidence":[{"title":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov.bf\/fileadmin\/user_upload\/storage\/fichiers\/Brochure_Loi_RAF_034-2012_AN__BD.pdf http:\/\/www.cns.bf\/IMG\/pdf\/annuaire_statistique_2016.pdf https:\/\/www.paris21.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Burkina%20Faso%20SDS%202016-2020.pdf https:\/\/www.data.gov.bf\/sites\/default\/files\/Politique_Open_Data_BODI.pdf","link":null}],"indicator_id":"A.LAND.TENURE","indicator_name":"Availability (L): Land tenure","indicator_name_medium":"Land tenure data","indicator_name_short":"Land tenure","responses":[{"response_id":"6","response_text":"Data is not available online.","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.INDIGENOUS","subquestion_id":"289","subquestion_text":"Datasets have information regarding indigenous people or marginalized populations."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.NATURALPERSONS","subquestion_id":"290","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving natural persons."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.LEGALPERSONS","subquestion_id":"291","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving legal persons."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.STATE","subquestion_id":"292","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving state land."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.COMMUNAL","subquestion_id":"293","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving communal lands."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.OPENACCESS","subquestion_id":"294","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving open access lands."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.TENURETYPE","subquestion_id":"295","subquestion_text":"The data covers urban and rural tenure, and other relevant forms of tenure."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.CONCESSIONS","subquestion_id":"296","subquestion_text":"The data covers and has information on land concessions and\/or leases."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.GEO","subquestion_id":"297","subquestion_text":"Each record has a geospatial reference that allows to assign features to a spatial extent."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.TRANSACTIONS","subquestion_id":"298","subquestion_text":"The data contains information on land transactions and sale-values."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.LANDRIGHTS","subquestion_id":"299","subquestion_text":"Each tenure record contains information about the rights held over the land (freehold, lease, etc.)."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.GENDER","subquestion_id":"23","subquestion_text":"Data includes information about individuals' sex and\/or gender."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

The National Statistics Council provides information showing, for example, several training courses conducted as part of the activities of the National Statistics System (NSS) structures (1). The Public Management and Statistics Support Program (PAGPS), with a \"statistics\" sub-program, also provides information on making quality and sufficiently analyzed statistical data available to users for the design, monitoring and evaluation of development policies and programs (2).\nFor the National Statistical Council, these trainings are for the benefit of statisticians, any statistical survey designer, statisticians-economists, macroeconomists, planners, or non-statisticians agents of the administration and any user of statistics (1).\nOnly that by consulting the training courses provided on the website of the National Council of Statistics, the recent year of publication of online training is 2018. But this does not mean that since then there have been no trainings provided just that it is not available in statistical form. Otherwise, it is recognized that the use of statistics is also very varied and very much related to the types of users. Training of some users of statistics has been done in the ARC-SSN and PAR-GS projects. They must be continued and extended within the framework of PAGPS (3). For example, a training workshop on tourism statistics was held in February 2021. This was for civil and political society, related to the field, which aims to raise awareness and train on statistics (4).\nSources :\n(1)http:\/\/cns.bf\/formations.html\n(2)http:\/\/www.pagps.net\/

Thus, the collection and publication of this information is part of the operational thrusts of operationalizing beneficial ownership, including thrust 2: Improve the mechanism for collecting beneficial ownership information and thrust 3: Strengthen the mechanism for disclosing beneficial ownership information.\nFor example, axis 2, the disclosure of beneficial ownership requires the establishment of an effective system. To do this, it is necessary to: - ensure the quality of information sources through the establishment of a register of beneficial owners, and to maintain and update it regularly; - establish a functional system for collecting and monitoring information on beneficial owners. This will be operationalized through the definition of a collection procedure and the eventual establishment of a computerized mechanism for collecting information on beneficial ownership between the Commercial Court, the General Directorate of the Mining Registry and the Permanent Secretariat of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (SP-ITIE).\nWith regard to axis 3, the strengthening of the beneficial ownership disclosure mechanism will result in systematic disclosure as required by the systematic data disclosure requirement. This will involve: - operationalizing a systematic disclosure system in the IT platform and the effective use of this support; - improving the publication of beneficial ownership in the EITI report through exchange activities with extractive companies and awareness-raising on the value of reporting beneficial owners in the EITI report and training in filling out forms for reporting beneficial owners of extractive companies retained in the scope for the EITI report  \nSource:\n(1): https:\/\/www.itie-bf.gov.bf\/IMG\/pdf\/plan_d_operationnalisation_de_la_propriete_effective_et_de_la_declaration_par_projet_adopte_27-12-2019.pdf","evidence":[],"indicator_id":"G.COMPANY.BOT","indicator_name":"Governance (CI): Beneficial ownership","indicator_name_medium":"Beneficial ownership  ","indicator_name_short":"Beneficial ownership frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"42","response_text":"They are being drafted, or are not yet implemented.","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"26","response_text":"Requirements to publish this information as open data are set out in binding policy, regulations, or law.","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.DEFN-OWN","subquestion_id":"245","subquestion_text":"Definitions comprehensively cover ownership."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.DEFN-CONTROL","subquestion_id":"273","subquestion_text":"Definitions cover control."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.EXCEPTIONS","subquestion_id":"274","subquestion_text":"Rules or processes exist to protect certain natural persons who are beneficial owners from having their data published."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e3.REGISTER","subquestion_id":"275","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require beneficial ownership data to be collected in a central register or database."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e3.TIMELY","subquestion_id":"17","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require that data is regularly updated."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."},{"response_id":"85","response_text":"They cover a limited number of localities or companies (e.g., only companies operating in a single sector or in a single sub-national jurisdiction\/state).","varname":"G.COMPANY.BOT.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"276","subquestion_text":"How widely do these laws, regulations, policies, or guidance apply?"}]},{"score":"0","justification":"There is no framework requiring that data collection and publication be accessible to people with disabilities.

The amount of this additional public financing is equal to the amount received by the political party or grouping of parties for the financing of the electoral campaign (3). \nSources :\n(1)https:\/\/www.assembleenationale.bf\/spip.php?article15 \n(2)https:\/\/cdn.accf-francophonie.org\/2019\/03\/Bulletin6-TI-Ch2.4-BurkinaFaso.pdf\n(3)http:\/\/www.ceni.bf\/sites\/default\/files\/CODE%20ELECTORAL%202020%20%20DEFINITIF_OK.pdf","evidence":[{"title":"http:\/\/www.ceni.bf\/sites\/default\/files\/CODE%20ELECTORAL%202020%20%20DEFINITIF_OK.pdf  https:\/\/academiedepolice.bf\/index.php\/telechargement\/category\/29-election?download=127:la-loi-portant-financement-des-partis-et-formations-politiques-et-des-campagnes-electorales  https:\/\/www.assembleenationale.bf\/spip.php?article15  http:\/\/www.ceni.bf\/?q=content\/code-%C3%A9lectoral-et-constitution https:\/\/cdn.accf-francophonie.org\/2019\/03\/Bulletin6-TI-Ch2.4-BurkinaFaso.pdf","link":null}],"indicator_id":"G.PI.POLFIN","indicator_name":"Governance (PI): Political finance","indicator_name_medium":"Political finance frameworks","indicator_name_short":"Political finance frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"9","response_text":"There is no mention of data or the publication of data in relevant laws, policies, or guidance.","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.DEFINITIONS","subquestion_id":"246","subquestion_text":"The framework contains clear and unambiguous definitions of campaigning activities of parties, candidates, and third parties."},{"response_id":"37","response_text":"The framework does not require the disclosure, public or otherwise, of a donor's identity.","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.DONORID","subquestion_id":"244","subquestion_text":"The framework requires donors' identities be made public."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.CONTRIBUTIONS","subquestion_id":"237","subquestion_text":"The framework requires collecting specific information on financial contributions."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.AL","subquestion_id":"26","subquestion_text":"The framework requires collecting specific information on assets and liabilities."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.INCOMESPENDING","subquestion_id":"243","subquestion_text":"The framework requires collecting specific information on income and spending."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.INKIND","subquestion_id":"25","subquestion_text":"The framework requires collecting specific information on in-kind and non-financial support."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e3.CAMPAIGNSCHEDULES","subquestion_id":"242","subquestion_text":"The framework requires regular updates, including updates in conjunction with campaigns and defined campaign schedules."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.POLFIN.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."}]},{"score":"100","justification":"The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) 2020 Election Code requires the collection or publication of data generated by and about public consultation on rulemaking (1).\nChapter 3 of the code requires the publication of a notice of intent prior to public consultation processes.
