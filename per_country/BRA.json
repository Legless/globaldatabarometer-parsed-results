Among its competencies is the management, organization of information technology services and database.\nensure SUS managers and similar bodies access to information technology services and databases. Some several systems and applications are part of DATASUS, as well as data processing (2). The systems are integrated bases of the National Health Information System. The SUS Informatics Department (DATASUS) develops norms, standards, service catalogs of the developed systems, to discipline the exchange of information between the Federal, Municipal, and District health systems and State, establishing conditions for interaction with federative entities and society (3). DATASUS provides a systematic record of mortality and survival data, Epidemiological and Morbidity information, information on Health Care for the population, records of hospital and outpatient networks, records of health establishments, information on financial resources, and Demographics and Socioeconomic information (4). The information is made available through TabNet (5), and it is possible to download data in historical series via spreadsheets in csv format. or graphics (6).\nThe Ministry of Health's integrated health surveillance platform (7) aims to assist managers and health workers in decision-making for the protection and promotion of the population's health, prevention, and control of risks, injuries, and diseases, in addition to being a social control mechanism for the general population, providing data on cities, birth rates, HIV, Covid, mortality and congenital anomalies. The platform is integrated with Datasus.\nThe Conect SUS platform was created to provide data and information about the National Vaccination Campaign against Covid-19 \u2013 2021 (8), such as ventilators, deaths, beds, hospital medications, tests. OpenDataSus is DataSus' open data platform (9).\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that in mid-March 2020 the federal government removed the information related to Covid 19 from the site, failing to report the total number of deaths per covid, and reducing the information in the daily bulletin, or the download tools ( 10). The media reported the deletion of data as a government strategy because of the growing number of deaths (11). Open Knowledge Brasil created the Covid-19 Transparency project in April 2020 to monitor the availability and quality of information about the pandemic. The project, which was born as the Covid-19 Transparency Index, was expanded in 2021, concerning vaccines and beds (12).

The service has an interactive system of panels with the following themes: forests and forest resources, forest policy and management, economic production and forestry market, teaching, and forestry research (7). Most dashboard data is out of date (8). The National Institute for Space Research provides geospatial data on conservation units (9).\nDespite the variety of information and data, open data is not linked or updated in the Brazilian Portal of Open Data.

The initiative was built on a series of documents, regulations, and standards. In a broader context, the initiative is influenced by the partnership with the Open Government Partnership (1) and the National Action Plans (currently the 4th Plan), and by the institution of a legal framework related to open data, digital government strategies, data governance, and interoperability: Access to Information Act, National Open Data Infrastructure, Open Data Policy, National Information Security Policy, General Personal Data Protection Act, and other related legislation (2).\nThe Federal Comptroller General (CGU) is the main body responsible for managing and overseeing the Policy - decree 9903 of 2019 (3), through the National Open Data Infrastructure (INDA) (4). A multi-stakeholder Management Committee supports INDA (5). The main resource for organizing the data is the Brazilian Open Data Portal (6), which works as a search and use catalog of data published by government agencies.\nThe planning of actions to implement and promote the opening of data by agencies is operationalized by the Open Data Plan (7). To execute the plan, there is an Open Data Plan Preparation Manual (8). The Federal Comptroller General created the Open Data Policy Monitoring Panel (9), which allows the population to verify whether the administrative bodies are complying with the legal provisions and compliance with the respective plan.\nThe execution of the Open Data Plans has a data availability schedule. However, there is a limitation of resources between public administration bodies and entities (10), according to initial information on the Portal.\nThe Portal is the reference for searching and accessing public data, its metadata, information, applications. Each agency should catalog data on the portal, following the guidelines of the Cataloging Manual (11) and the Open Data Kit (12), which is a set of tools and guidance documents for the implementation of the Open Data Policy.\nDespite the robustness of the Policy (13), which consists of a commitment to openness (1), a data infrastructure (4), with a portal (6) and guidance documents (12), implementation resources (8), and follow-up the adoption of open data from public bodies (9), the role of the Comptroller General of the Union is not clear. It is not possible to obtain information on the initiative's maintenance budget (14), as the IT Spending Panel is under maintenance. Finally, there is no clarity about the role of the INDA Management Committee (http:\/\/wiki.dados.gov.br\/Comite-Gestor-da-INDA.ashx), whose last stock balance update is in December 2018 (15 ) This negatively affects the government's commitment to transparency, one of the pillars of the partnership with the Open Government Partnership, a recurring theme in public consultations for the preparation of Action Plans (16).\n\nSource:\n\n(1):https:\/\/www.gov.br\/cgu\/pt-br\/governo-aberto\n(2): https:\/\/www.gov.br\/governodigital\/pt-br\/legislacao\n(3): http:\/\/www.planalto.gov.br\/ccivil_03\/_ato2019-2022\/2019\/decreto\/D9903.htm. \n(4): http:\/\/www.dados.gov.br\/pagina\/instrucao-normativa-da-inda. \n(5): http:\/\/wiki.dados.gov.br\/Comite-Gestor-da-INDA.ashx. \n(6): http:\/\/www.dados.gov.br\/. \n(7): http:\/\/www.planalto.gov.br\/ccivil_03\/_ato2015-2018\/2016\/decreto\/D8777.htm.

Some bodies are approving open data plans and reorganizing the bases, and this appears to be a very time-consuming process; or even, there are data available in different repositories, as in the case of campaign financing data. In other cases, the bodies create their own policies on the availability of open data, in addition to providing a dashboard to guide the user, as in the case of donations and party fund data.\nRegarding conflicts of interest, the Electronic System for the Prevention of Conflicts of Interest is a good indication of transparency and offer of open data, on the other hand, the declaration data of public employees' assets are being used for checking the tax return, and this has implications for general personal data protection law.\nData on lobbying are not available because the country does not have a regulation on the activities, so researchers and researchers cross open data, such as agendas and visits with public officials, to assess hypotheses about lobbying.\nWith regard to social participation, control and data from public consultations, there was a restriction of the spaces for participation with the\nDecree No. 9,759, which \"extinguishes and establishes guidelines, rules and limitations for collegiate bodies of the direct federal, autarchic and foundational public administration\". The decree also revoked the National Policy on Social Participation (1). The lack of rules for public administration bodies and entities regarding public consultations, from the internal procedure to the rendering of accounts, was evident. No evidence was found on the organization of consultations at the level of the Secretariat of Government, the body responsible for the mechanisms of social participation in government.\nAmong the integrity data, the framework of the law of access to information is the consistent one. \n\nThe Integrity Program of the General Office of the Union, responsible for monitoring all bodies, consists of a structured set of institutional measures for the prevention, detection, punishment of corruption and fraud (2). The Program is structured into four axes: commitment and support from Senior Management, existence of a unit responsible for implementing the program, management of risks associated with the integrity theme, and continuous monitoring of the Program's attributes (3). The first Version of the Integrity Plan carried out a diagnosis of the structure and functioning of integrity management and proposed to organize and strengthen the axes of the Integrity Program (4). The second version of the Integrity Plan created a Governance Committee and established procedures for structuring, executing and monitoring integrity programs in Federal Government bodies and entities (ministries, autarchies and public foundations) (5).\nA Public Integrity Panel was created to verify how each agency\/entity is monitoring and implementing the integrity program (6). There are eight indicators on the panel: position of the Integrity Management unit; internal flow for nepotism verification; existence of an ethics committee; internal flow for conflict of interest analysis; internal flow of complaint handling; technical area of \u200b\u200bconducting disciplinary proceedings; survey of risks to integrity; determination of areas responsible for management risks; integrity plan approval.\nDashboard data cannot be downloaded. The mapping flow is done on the organs, but there is no assessment of the quality of information, and despite the existence of a comparison system between the organs on the panel, it is not possible to obtain detailed information between organs from different areas (7). The data refer to the implementation and execution of the management system in public integrity.\n\nSource:\n(1)\nSenna, M.C.M. 2020.What voices want to silence?

The State-Owned Companies Law provides rules on transparency, risk management, and requirement for compliance programs that improve the instruments and mechanisms for managing and combating\/preventing corruption (3).\nAccording to reports by \"Transpar\u00eancia Internacional, Brazil\" (4) investigations in recent years have exposed the participation of public (state) companies in billionaire schemes of corruption. This may have led the private sector to create measures of corporate transparency and compliance areas between corporations.\nA study by \"Transparencia Internacional\" (4) evaluated the 110 Brazilian companies that disclosed information about their anti-corruption practices, their organizational structure, and their financial data related to operations in other countries. The survey with 106 companies computed the average score performance was 5.7 and demonstrates that there is much to be improved.\nThe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative study (5) (February 2021): assessed the potential to improve transparency and governance in Brazil's mining, oil and gas sectors. The results indicate that despite this very broad legal framework, it is still necessary to improve its application in specific sectors.\nThe main legal guidelines are Normative Instruction No. 1863, Chapter 4, which defines beneficial owners as the individual who ultimately or indirectly owns, controls or influences the individual in whose name a transaction is carried out\" (6).\nThe rules for information on the final beneficiaries are organized by the executive declaratory act of the General Coordination for the Management of Records No. 9 (7).\nThe country has the National Strategy to Combat Corruption and Money Laundering created in 2003 (8).

The actions are monitored by working groups, various bodies, and institutions to carry out studies and legal-normative and database composition diagnoses, prepare legislative proposals, investigate the state of the art of registration systems, investigate needs and promote solutions in IT, seek efficiency in the generation of statistics and hold events aimed at the evolution of themes through debates. Actions for the year 2019 included the development of a digital platform project and other measures aimed at public transparency, open data, and social participation (9). Actions for the year 2020 included the elaboration and dissemination of a catalog\/portfolio of virtual and free training opportunities for public observers, as well as the adoption of other initiatives and instruments that encourage transparency and the provision of open data (10).

Law no. 13,853, of July 8, 2019 (4) established measures to ensure compliance with data protection rules, created the National Data Protection Authority, a body linked to the Presidency of the Republic, and the National Council for the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy.\nThe authority is responsible for drafting the guidelines for the National Policy for the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy; monitor and apply sanctions in case of non-compliance with the law or irregularities. The authority must promote knowledge of the norms for the population, safety and security policies, and cooperate with authorities in other countries.\n\nThe National Council for the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy acts as a consultation body for the national authority, proposing guidelines, providing subsidies for the creation of national policy, preparation of studies, debates, and public hearings (4). The Council is composed of members of civil society and public authorities, who were recently selected through a public notice (5).\n\n\nSource:\n(1) LUGATI, L.N.; ALMEIDA, J.E. de.
