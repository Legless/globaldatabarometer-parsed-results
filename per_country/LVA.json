At the same time, the framework does not require collecting information on significant changes in assets and liabilities, nor disclosure of income and assets of family members.\nThe State Revenue Service collects declarations from all public officials, except those working in State security authorities, who have to submit the declaration to the Director of the Constitution Protection Bureau, and the Head of the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau, which together with the Director of the Constitution Protection Bureau must submit declarations to the Prime Minister or to his\/her authorised person. These depository body also have to verify the accuracy of the submitted information, while the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau audits the information to identify violations of the law. Declarations of interest and assets must be made upon taking and leaving office and be updated annually. The Law mandates the State Revenue Service to make all declarations to be made publicly available online through a dedicated portal on its website. However, only those parts of the declarations which do not harm the protection of personal data are published. Regulation No. 478 of the Cabinet of Ministers (2002, amended 2016) [2] prescribes the procedures for the completion, submission, registration, and keeping of declarations. It also provides the template according to which officials have to submit the information, including publishable and non-publishable part. Thus, the regulation supports the collection of structured data. The framework requires declarations of the President, Members of the Parliament, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and city councillors to be published within one month after submission to the State Revenue Service, and declarations of all other public officials to be published within three months after submission to the State Revenue Service.

In September 2019, the Parliamentary Committee on Defence, Corruption and Internal Affairs set up a Working Group tasked with drafting regulation on lobbying [1], to be presented and voted by the Parliament by the end of the legislature in 2022. The Working Group includes representatives from different interest groups, including civil society, private sector and institutional counterparts. In January 2021, the Committee published a document [2] outlining number of basic principles that will serve as input for the draft law, expected to be made available for extensive public consultation in late 2021. Amongst others, relevant principles in the document include: i) a definition of \"interest representative\" that is broad enough to include all the main interest groups, including NGOs; and ii) a centralised register of interest representatives, where they would have to disclose their area of activity, clients, targets of lobbying and interactions with public decision-makers. As of May 2021, there was still lack of clarity with regard to the specific format and functionalities of the register, and whether information will be provided as open data.

The Pre-Election Campaign Law (2012, amended 2021) lays down additional provision concerning campaign activities of parties, candidates and third parties [4]. The framework covers all political parties active in the national territory and running for national, local and European elections. The Law on Financing of Political Parties requires political parties to prepare and submit annual reports with information on their assets, liabilities, income and spending as well as declarations of income and expenses of electoral campaigns. The framework also mandates political parties to record and report information on financial contributions, in-kind and non-financial support, and disclose the identity of the donors. Corporate donations are banned. The Law on Pre-Election Campaigns provides clear definitions of campaigning activities, candidates and third parties. Pre-election incomes and expenses of candidates are considered as expenses of the party and accounted in the relevant election declarations. The Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (CPCB) is the public body in charge of the collection and publication of the data. The framework requires a verification process from the CPCB, which has to carry out audits on annual declarations within 4 months after submission and inspect declaration of electoral incomes and expenditures within one month after the election has taken place. In addition, the CPCB must examine the conformity of donations, gifts and membership fees within 45 days after they have been reported and carry out additional examinations in cases of irregularities. The framework mandates the CPCB to publish on its website annual reports and election statements no later than 10 days after their submission, and information on donations, gifts and membership fees no later than 7 days after they have been reported. Regulations No. 417 and No. 591 lay down provisions for the specific data points to be reported by political parties when submitting information on their finances. For membership fees, gifts and donations these include name of the donors and political parties, type and value of donations and date.

There are also isolated cases of scholars and private sector using this data, though the purpose is limited to academic research and promotion of services rather than accountability as such. Civil society organisations and activists have mostly used data on political financing and interest and asset declarations, in conjunction with on company ownership and public procurement, to develop web platforms, tools, and apps, allowing users to easily explore data and detect political corruption, conflict of interest and other irregularities. Recent relevant examples include the platform \"Deput\u0101ti uz Delnas by Transparency International Latvia [1], the web app \"Opener\" [2], by Transparency International Estonia and Transparency International Latvia, as well as a web app developed by a data activist that allows users to explore in detail the private interests of candidates through network visualisations [3]. Media in Latvia have mostly used data on political financing and interest and asset declarations to expose irregularities in public officials' conduct, to verify potential conflict of interest in their decisions, and to ascertain whether public officials' declared wealth and possessions corresponded to reality. In a number of cases, media have used the data to raise public awareness about newly elected or appointed top-level officials. In other cases, they have used the data to corroborate findings from law enforcement or journalist investigations.[4][5] It is difficult to identify a direct causal link between specific civil society initiatives or media reports using data on political integrity and measures taken by the government as a result. However, it might be argued that their consistent use by journalists to identify corruption and bad governance, as well as their employment by civil society to enhance public scrutiny, have contributed to keep a high public awareness about the ever-present corruption risks in Latvia's politics as well as relevant issues in the current availability and quality of data. Over time, this has prompted the government to strengthen measures in relevant political integrity areas. For example, in 2019 the legislation on political party financing was amended to increase six-fold the amount of public financing to political parties in order to reduce political parties' dependence on private actors to carry out their activities. In 2019, the law on Conflict of Interest was also amended to prohibit MPs to take up paid positions in civil society organisations and foundations, reportedly to prevent that their private interests in those organisations would influence their public decision-making.\n\nSources\n\n(1) Website \"Deput\u0101ti uz Delnas\" - https:\/\/www.deputatiuzdelnas.lv\/\n(2) Website \"Opener\" - https:\/\/opener.ee\/\n(3) Website - App to monitor interests of candidates to Latvia's local elections - https:\/\/aivisb.shinyapps.io\/202103_PV2021\/\n(4) Media Article - LSM.lv \"Magazine IR: OIK businessmen have donated 1.3 million euros to the parties\" - https:\/\/www.lsm.lv\/raksts\/zinas\/latvija\/zurnals-oik-biznesmeni-partijam-ziedojusi-13-miljonus-eiro.a323804\/\n(5) Media Article - Delfi.lv \"Vespa, debts and loans - What the declarations of the Riga City Executive show\" - https:\/\/www.delfi.lv\/news\/national\/politics\/vespa-paradi-un-aizdevumi-ko-rigas-domes-vadiba-uzrada-savas-deklaracijas.d?id=53352015","evidence":[{"title":"Website \"Deput\u0101ti uz Delnas\"","link":"https:\/\/www.deputatiuzdelnas.lv\/"},{"title":"Website \"Opener\"","link":"https:\/\/opener.ee\/"},{"title":"Website - App to monitor interests of candidates to Latvia's local elections","link":"https:\/\/aivisb.shinyapps.io\/202103_PV2021\/"},{"title":"Media Article - LSM.lv \"Magazine IR: OIK businessmen have donated \u20ac1.3 million to political parties\"","link":"https:\/\/www.lsm.lv\/raksts\/zinas\/latvija\/zurnals-oik-biznesmeni-partijam-ziedojusi-13-miljonus-eiro.a323804\/"},{"title":"Media Article - Delfi.lv \"Vespa, debts and loans - What the declarations of the Riga City Executive show\"","link":"https:\/\/www.delfi.lv\/news\/national\/politics\/vespa-paradi-un-aizdevumi-ko-rigas-domes-vadiba-uzrada-savas-deklaracijas.d?id=53352015"}],"indicator_id":"U.PI.ACCOUNT","indicator_name":"Use (PI): Accountability uses of PI","indicator_name_medium":"Accountability uses of data","indicator_name_short":"Accountability uses of data","responses":[{"response_id":"69","response_text":"There are a number of cases of actors or entities using this kind of open data for accountability purposes.","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"30","subquestion_text":"Is there evidence of this data being used for accountability purposes?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.CSO","subquestion_id":"29","subquestion_text":"Civil society organizations regularly use this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.MEDIA","subquestion_id":"32","subquestion_text":"The media regularly uses this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.ACADEMIA","subquestion_id":"33","subquestion_text":"Scholars or academic institutions regularly use this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"35","subquestion_text":"The private sector regularly uses this data for accountability purposes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"20","subquestion_text":"At least one of the examples identified describes using artificial Intelligence or machine learning to process data"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"U.PI.ACCOUNT.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"21","subquestion_text":"There is evidence that these uses have had or are having meaningful positive impacts."}]},{"score":"21","justification":"Public procurement data in Latvia are used by government and non-governmental organizations in different tools.
