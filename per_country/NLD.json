Namely, 'Emission Registration' (1) and the 'Environmental Data Compendium' (2), two platforms by the State Government, datasets by the Dutch Emission Authority published on the national data portal (3), and pages dedicated to emissions data on the open data platform of Statistics Netherlands (CBS) (4). CBS offers interactive tables, bar diagrams and graphs that can be filtered by different types of emissions, time periods and sectors (f.i. total Dutch economy, agriculture, households). The do the same for IPCC greenhouse emissions, per climate sector (industry, farming, mobility, urban areas), per quarter. The data can also be downloaded in CSV- and JSON-format. The Emission Registration database contains almost 100,000,000 emission figures. They offer different ranked lists, and it is possible to create maps and graphs, for different emissions, time periods and sources. The data can also be exported in XLSX. The Environmental Data Compendium offers data figures, visualisations, analytics and fact sheets on different topics. The dataset on Data.government.nl concerns the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases  reported by participants in the European Trading System (EU ETS), so emissions by (large industrial) installations that fall under the scope of these regulations. They can be downloaded in ODS-format for different time periods between 2008-2019. \n\nAll the data from all platforms  is openly licensed (CC-BY 4.0), and available free of charge  in machine-readable formats. Overall, the data seems to be timely and updated. The Emission Registration does not provide any info, but the CBS datasets were updated June 16th 2021, and November 9th 2020, and the data on Data.government.nl on August 4th 2021. The Compendium offers many different products on different themes, which are all published once in a certain time period. Some of their data goes back as far as 1986, and they provide graphs and analyses in which changes are tracked. The CBS and Emission Registration data covers 1990-2019 (and 2019-2020 with regards to the IPCC data). \n\nThe data provides national coverage. It is possible to download data in bulk on the CBS platform, and through an Emission Registration API. (5)  Also, the datasets include detailed information on greenhouse gas emissions and targets reported to the UNFCCC: reports and datasets refer to IPCC methods and requirements abided in the collection and analysis of the data.

For instance mammals, reptiles, amphibians, molluscs, fishes, butterflies, dragonflies, mosses, lichens, and vascular plants from the EU Habitat Directive, and birds from the EU Bird Directive. The data shows numbers and trends between 1992 and 2019 (depending on the dataset). Within some of these indicators there are different subcategories, like hazel mouse, root vole, beaver and otter in mammals. There is no comprehensive list that combines all animal types and all varieties of species within these categories. (1) There is also a Green and Red List aggregated data set, which shows how many animal sorts per category (mammals, reptiles) are safe, vulnerable, endangered, severely endangered, and extinct. (2) All Compendium data is published under an open license and can also be downloaded for free in ODS and XLSX. And each dataset comes with an explanation of where the data comes from, how the data has been collected, and what kind of limitations are apparent with regards to availability and methodology.\n\n\nFurthermore, On the website for protected species from the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, there are multiple lists available that all provide Red List information about a certain category of animals. Green List data is available to a certain extent, but also not on a high level of detail. (3) Lastly, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) also has a page in their data portal dedicated to species threatened with extinction (according to the Red List Indicator). It shows the percentage of different species in different years, compared to 1995 (which serves as the starting point of 100 percent). (4) The categories are: amphibians, breeding birds, butterflies, vascular plants, dragonflies, reptiles and mammals (with no subcategories). Is it possible to view the data in a table or graph, and to download it (also in bulk), in HTML, CSV and JSON. So it is machine-readable, and also the data is free of charge and openly licensed (CC BY 4.0). It is updated every year (last on June 16th 2021).

The platform 'Climate Effect Atlas' offers interactive maps of the country, which 'can be used to gain a picture of the physical consequences of climate change in an area, and how this will impact residents and the environment'. However, this platform was developed by research institutions (like Wageningen University) and is managed by Climate Adaptation Services (CAS). This organisation does work with the governmental  Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), plus in 2020  the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management commissioned CAS to update and expand the Climate Impact Atlas. So there the government does promote the availability of climate adaptation information though this platform, but cannot be deemed the result of government action. (1)  Also, this platform offers great insight into and access to the information through visualisation (in maps), but it is only possible to download PDFs of the maps through the 'printer' option. Soon it will be possible to request GIS files with the geographical data, through a form, but this is not yet available. As soon as it is, this data will be public: it is an open platform. \n\nCurrently, the data is available as ArcGIS Online content via the ArcGIS website. This makes it possible for example, to use the data in a GIS framework without having to download it. However, this still means it is not possible for anyone to download open, machine-readable datasets. And Esri NL publishes the datasets of ArcGIs with terms of use: for instance, it is mandatory to include copyright references, it is not allowed to distribute the data or use it in navigation systems, et cetera. (2) The Atlas data is based on KNMIs climate scenarios, which are defined on IPCC's data and models. (3) \n\nThe data contains information on everything from future natural hazards, to extreme weather events and climate variability. The Climate Effect Atlas main map can be filtered on different themes: waterlogging, flooding, drought, and heat. Also, there are different 'map layers' with different boxes that can be checked to show them on the map: climate change (f.i. amount of days above 20\/25\/30 degrees, amount of frost and snow days, days with more than 15\/25 mm of rain), physical consequences (f.i. risk of heating surface water and shortages, wildfire susceptibility, land subsidence 2020-2100), sectoral impacts (f.i. urban areas, lonely elderly people, risk of rotting building foundations, flood impact reduction opportunities) and basic maps (f.i. percentage of paving per neighborhood, types of landscape). (4) Furthermore, the platform offers 'map narratives': these provide background information to the main maps. They tell you what you see on the maps and help you to set to work with the information. In addition, the map narratives provide a basis for potential solution strategies.' In other words, they explain the different categories, topics and filters. (5) \n\nThe website is updated several times a year, with new maps being added. In between, minor adjustments are made. If new KNMI climate scenarios are available, a large-scale update will take place because this affects many maps. New KNMI scenarios are expected in 2023. The data draws on granular local information. The maps have been developed using national data: the results provide a picture at regional scale and are usually rough and indicative at a local level. At the national level, the maps represent the best data that is publicly available. The scale level of the data differs per map layer. Maps with statistics, such as the number of tropical days or precipitation deficit, show differences at the national level. Other maps, such as the wind chill heat map, are more detailed. Since the Atlas is based on national data, in many cases, it is possible to find more detailed data at the regional and local levels. For instance, many district water boards have conducted detailed analyses of their territory and more detailed information may also be made available by provincial and municipal authorities.

(1) The Chamber of Commerce (KvK) is responsible for keeping and supplying the register with Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBO). Through the KvK-website, it is possible to download company extracts from the register, in PDF-format, but only for a fee of \u20ac2,50 each. (2) So, no bulk data is available. Also, users need to register first. Additionally, there is an API that can be used to search the KvK database by company name or KvK-registration number, using a UBO-register filter, but it is not possible to search by a person's name. (3) This makes it hard to discover people who have conflicting interests, whilst preventing corruption is supposedly a main goal of the register. Lastly, the data is provided in Dutch. So overall, the accessibility of the data is quite restricted. As for the use of the data, it is not openly licensed. Nine restrictions are stipulated in the terms of use, based on database rights. Two examples: The Customer may only use the Trade Register data, including the UBO-data, in a manner that is not in conflict with laws and regulations, nor does it infringe the rights of KVK or third parties. The Customer is obliged to prevent the use of Trade Register data giving the impression that the customer performs the statutory tasks assigned to the Chamber of Commerce. (4)\n\nThe following UBO-data is publicly available (after payment and registration, with user restrictions): first and last name, month of birth and year of birth, nationality, country of residence, and the nature and size of the interest that a UBO has within an organization (for instance: shareholder, 25%). For certain authorities empowered by law, like investigative bodies, and for The Financial Intelligence Unit, banks or other Wwft (anti-corruption and -terrorism) institutions with a financial task, all information is accessible, so also the personal data that is not made available to others. (5) The obligation for legal entities in the Netherlands to register their UBO's within the Company Register, was created on September 27th, 2020, when the Implementation Act entered into force. The time that existing companies were given to register, was 18 months - so they have until end of May 2022. Because of this term, a lot information is still missing. At the beginning of June 2021, the register contained 209.403 entries. (6) It should be noted that this survey only covers the period up to May 1st, so it cannot be said with certainty how many entries there were at that time.

However, it does not apply to all types of companies, for instance not to sole proprietorships, listed limited liability companies (BVs) and public limited liability companies (NVs), some associations, et cetera.

The responsibility for maintaining and publishing the company information, lies with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK), a commercial institution. The KvK sells different 'products', datasets, for each company. An 'extract' contains the most important company information, inter alia, the following: it's KvK-number (a unique company identifier), trade name(s), the start, continuation or end date, information about the person(s) to whom it belongs, and the location(s). (1) It tells users who they are dealing with, who is authorized to sign, and whether there has been a bankruptcy. (2) The KvK also sells other products, like the statutes, annual reports, terms of use and historical data of companies, and for instance address files tailored to specific branch or region. \n \nThere is no legal requirement for published company data, including UBO-data, to be 'open', in the sense that it should be free of rights, free of costs and published according to open standards. (3) The Chamber of Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel, KvK), which is responsible for the maintaining and publicizing of company information, (4) publishes the register online, where it is possible to search by trade name, KvK-number, address and type of legal entity. To access more information, the user then has to register himself through an account, and pay a fee, the level of which depends how much information and what type of data he is requesting. The main company information extract costs \u20ac7,70, and is provided in PDF-format. (5) The KvK also publishes a weekly updated Trade Register Open Data Set on its website, with anonymized, so not complete, company data. It can be downloaded in a machine-readable CSV-format. (6) Apart from this dataset, only the yearly accounts of micro, small and medium legal entities are provided in a machine-readable format: XBRL, a digital file of code that can be entered into a software program. However, this data is not 'open': a file costs \u20ac7,70. Also, KvK offers a standardized, so more structured but not machine-readable version of the accounts of all companies for \u20ac3,15. These HTML-files contain the balance sheet and profit and loss account, as filed by the company, in a standard format, making it easy to compare the figures or different years or companies. (7) \n\nNone of the company data is openly licenced. Terms of Use apply to all information in the Trade Register. There are nine restrictions, based on database rights. Two examples: The Customer may only use the Trade Register data, including the UBO-data, in a manner that is not in conflict with laws and regulations, nor does it infringe the rights of KVK or third parties. The Customer is obliged to prevent the use of Trade Register data giving the impression that the customer performs the statutory tasks assigned to the Chamber of Commerce. (8)\n\nThe trade register can be searched through this API: https:\/\/www.kvk.nl\/zoeken\/handelsregister\/.  Users can purchase products related to the companies they find through this API. Also, there is a KvK-API:  a connection between a users software application and the Trade Register, for a monthly fee of \u20ac5,15, plus \u20ac0,016 per data request. The connection can be made through the KvK's developer portal.

According to the Civil Code, the Ministry of Justice and Security is responsible for policies for the civil registration process at a national level, while individual municipalities are responsible for registering vital events and maintaining records. Information from each registration record is entered in the population register of the municipality. The Basic Registration of Persons (BRP) Act designated the Ministry of the Interior for the task to maintain a central population register (the BRP) that  contains and synchronizes all personal records from all municipalities daily.\n\nThe National Office for Identity Data (Rvig) is responsible for overseeing the BRP data-sharing process and data quality (and for instance managing travel document systems), but CRVS data can be accessed through the open data platform of Statistics Netherlands (CBS). CBS has been authorized to receive all data required to compile population statistics, including vital statistics. This is in line with requirements and standards from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), Eurostat, and the Council of Europe. (1)\n\nCBS has developed a Dashboard population data dashboard with the most basic population facts, figures and visualisation. Via this dashboard you can also access underlying datasets with specific data regarding mortality, genders and age distribution, households, life expectancy, average life cycle, and migration. (2) Apart from this dashboard, CBS offers lots of different datasets, which all provide information on a specific topic within a category (like mortality and birth) through interactive tables (which can be filtered), graphs and the possibly the download the raw data. \n\nIn publishing cause of death information, the World Health Organization guidelines are used (where possible) to classify and code causes of death. Coding of the data happens automatically with IRIS, which is \"an automated, interactive mortality coding software system, which codes multiple causes of death and selects the underlying cause of death for statistical tabulation.\" (3) IRIS is\nbased upon the international death certificate form that the WHO provides in Volume 2 of ICD-10, meaning the causes of death are coded following ICD-10 rules. This makes the data fully interoperable. (4) All the causes of death, per 100.000 people, per year, can be found in a CBS dataset about health, lifestyle, health care use and case of death (from 1900). (5) The amount of deaths per region per month, can be found in a CBS dataset about population development. (6) And specific information about the amount of deaths per demographic (age category) per year in the country dan be found in another dataset. (7) \n\nBirth information is also distributed over different datasets. There is one  with key figures, like the amount of life births and stillbirths, boys and girls, single and multiple births, and the average mother and father age (from 1950). (8) There is also a map with data providing insight into the amount of births and deaths per municipality, (9) and a  table dataset that contains the amount of life births in the most recent months, which can be filtered for every municipality, province and country section. (10) Furthermore, there is a dataset showing the amount and average amount of births by women with Dutch or migration backgrounds. (11) There is no data about the educational attainment of mothers, or the usual place of residence of parents. There is also no information available in any dataset about live-birth order and interval between last and previous live births to mother,  gestational age, birth weight, place and month of birth registration, site of delivery, attendant at birth, and month in which prenatal care began.\n\nLike all CBS-data, the CRSV-datasets are openly licensed under the CC BY 4.0 licence and available free of charge. Also, each dataset can be downloaded in a machine-readable CSV-format.\nData is continually updated, but how frequently depends on each dataset, but all of them have been updated this month or the one before. And the 'population counter' on the population dashboard is real time: it shows how many people are born and deceased every few seconds.  Historical changes in the data can be tracked: Each dataset provides data per year or per period and the start and end dates differ. The data does not include information on data limitations, specifically on the completeness of vital statistics in different provinces, counties, or regions of the country.\n\n (1) Center of Excellence for CRVS systems, 'Country profiles.

There is a platform that provides insights into the capacity (hospital beds, IC primarily) on Zorg-capaciteit.nl, but this website provides this data only after registration, which is only available to those who work in the healthcare system. (1) There are some public websites that provide information regarding the capacity of the healthcare system on different levels and over time. For instance,  Zorginzicht.nl\/openbare-data hand Opendisdata.nl. However, this data is not real time. \n\nThe Corona Dashboard set up by the government does include current data regarding new hospital and IC admissions, but only  in relation to COVID-19, and this data does not say anything about the maximum capacity. (2) The dashboard also provides information about vaccinations: mostly about the number of administered vaccinations, but also the available stock. (3) The Dashboard data is updated twice a week, so not technically real-time but quite current. The hospital admission data is available as open data (CSV, JSON), the vaccination capacity data is not. (4)  Furthermore, there is the National Coordination Centre for Patient Distribution, which was established at the quest of the Ministry of Health - so not by the government itself - by National Network Acute Care, a network organisation consisting of the eleven Dutch hospitals that have a trauma center. They provide a 'live URL', which is updated once a day monday through friday, and through which data set in CSV-format can be downloaded that contains national figures on the amount of clinic beds occupied by Covid-patients, ICU-beds occupied by patients with and without Covid, and the number of new admissions to the IC and clinics.

It is part of the Land Registry: 'ownership information' is one of the products the organisation offers. Each data extract (which consists of the information of one house or land parcel), contains information on: who is the owner, who may use all or part of the property,  what restrictions apply to the use (for example, whether the property is a monument), what the surface area is (not with flats) and the sales price from the last deed of sale, and in case of mortgage, the amount (if these numbers are known). Individual owners (natural persons) are identified by the following information: gender (Mr\/Mrs), first and last name, residential address, date and place of birth, and civil (marital) state. The information is based on another basic registry: the Personal Records Database (BRP). When the owner is a legal entity, the company information extract of the registry contains the company name, legal form, KvK-number, and address.  The beneficial ownership of land within a company is not registered. However, it is registered with respect to both individuals and companies, which type of (limited) right every rightholder has, like property right burdened with a lease, emphyteusis, right of emphyteusis, right of superficies, usufruct, etc. The registry also contains the share to which someone is entitled (f.i. 1\/2). (1)\n\nThe data covers all land parcels in the country, which can be found through the Kadaster-API, by entering an address or postal code: https:\/\/www.kadaster.nl\/. Then the user can choose 5 different products for this parcel: extracts from the data he can buy. They are: 'Ownership information', 'Purchase price information', 'Mortgage information', 'House report', and 'Cadastral map'.\nA parcel is a piece of land of which the Land Registry has measured the boundaries and which has been assigned its own number. The Cadastre does not have addresses for land plots without buildings, such as agricultural land, building plots or green spaces, but they do provide the tenure information on these land. (2) The data covers every type of land, so also for instance farm land and state land (which, according to article 5:24 of the Dutch Civil Code, also includes every piece of land that does not have an owner). (3) Every extract of ownership information of a certain parcel, contains its coordinates. These are RD-coordinates: State triangle coordinates. (4) But to assess the position of a parcel, the product 'Cadastral map' can be downloaded (bought). The cadastral map shows the overall location of a cadastral parcel in its vicinity. On the map, you can see the cadastral parcel boundaries, parcel numbers and the most important buildings, among other things. (5) \n\nThe main barriers to accessibility and usability are  the terms of use, the pay barrier and the closed file format. For every extract of ownership data, a product needs to be bought. The data cannot be accessed without paying 2,95 for each extract, so per parcel. Furthermore, every product is only offered in pdf-format, so the data is not machine-readable. Lastly, the data is not openly licensed. When a Land Registry product is received, the pdf-file states: 'With regard to the cadastral information, the Land Registry and the Public Registers Service, reserves the right as referred to in Article 2 paragraph 1 in conjunction with Article 6 paragraph 3 of the Databases Act.' (6) Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Act gives the owner of a database the sole right to give others permission to reuse the data. (7) The Kadaster has established terms of use, in which (under '6. usage rights'), it determines for example 'Personal data provided by the Land Registry may not be used by the customer in derived products or services with a commercial (profit-oriented) purpose.' (8)\n\nThe Kadaster register is continually updated, because new deeds and documents are continuously provided to complete new registrations and change existing ones. However, different types of information take different amounts of time (hours, days, weeks) to be processed. (9) If users want to request historical data about previous owners of a parcel to track changes of time, this costs at least \u20ac73.50 euros. (10)  For people or organisations carrying out research with an historical purpose however, it is possible to use the Kadaster archives for free. (11) \n\nIt is always possible that government registrations are missing required data. Land ownership and the rights to a piece of land constantly change, and as stated before it can take time to process changes, or landowners and rights holders can omit to report changes. When users (governments or citizens) want to report changes or a suspected mistake in the registry, they can submit a notification via a digital form. (12)  Government agencies even have a legal obligation to do this.

On this platform almost all financial information that undergoes public scrutiny by the House of Parliament is publicly available. The 'Miljoenennota' which describes the economic and financial situation in the country, expected future developments and the most important plans, costs and implications for the coming year is available.  The 'Rijksbegroting', stating the budget allocated to each\nMinistry and their expected expenses is published alongside this Miljoenennota. Unfortunately the enacted budget is not published as a whole, but rather is made available through graphics visualising government spending en income. The 'Voorjaarsnota', 'Najaarsnota' together form the in-year budget reports and mid-year reports, and the so-called 'Rijksjaarverslag' that contains annual financial reports of all ministries are also published on this website. The 'Rijksjaarverslag' needs to be audited and approved by the National Audit Institute before it is presented to the House of Parliament. \n\nNext to presenting these documents on this website many of the financial information is also published as open data (2). These open datasets which are organised according to the formats provided in the 'Rijksbegrotingsvoorschriften' contain the public information that is also sent to the House of Representatives in the official documents, highlighting the budget figures through visualisation and making them trackable over time (3). Data is presented in different formats, is free of charge, openly licensed according CC-0 and also accessible via an API (4). One of the biggest issues is that there is no data or information available regarding public budgets and spending on the most disaggregated level: transactions. Additionally, the open datasets in most cases  do not use common identifiers to connect budget and budget performance data, or identifiers that can be used to connect budget data to major projects and procurement processes. The open datasets are checked by the team behind Rijksfinancien.nl before publication, responsibility for the content lies with the ministries (3).\n\n(1) https:\/\/www.rijksfinancien.nl\/\n(2)

The Register contains around 110 lobbyists who have this permanent pass. The register, which is publicly available on the House of Representatives' website (1), is voluntary, regularly updated and outlines the name, company and actor for which the lobbying is done. However, the actual number of lobbyists present in the Hague however, is believed to be in the thousands.

For example the tool open-lobby by the Open State Foundation provides insight into all the agendas of ministers and state secretaries with external organisations (2). Although this scraped data is far from complete it shows that 26,6% of the reported appointments are with companies, 20% with business representatives and 7,8% with civil society organisations (3).

These datasets are available free of charge, annual reports are published as PDFs, all other data in XLS format.

While data regarding the finance of political campaigns is up-to-date, the most recent financial reports stem from 2019. \n\nAlthough political parties are required to provide all information, in practice this is not always the case. A report from the Commission 'toezicht financi\u00ebn politieke partijen' showed that for the elections of 2021 three parties didn't  provide any information at all, five did not provide complete information, and 18 parties didn't provide the information in time (4).  Dutch political parties are perfectly aware of the loopholes in the legal framework regarding the financing of political parties. A recent study of the newspaper de Telegraaf (4) in which a journalist posed as an entrepreneur seeking to donate \u20ac15.000 to various political parties on the condition of him remaining anonymous. As earlier mentioned this donation of \u20ac15.000 is well over the maximum amount of a total of \u20ac4.500 in which individuals can remain anonymous. Only four parties (Socialist Party, Party for Animals, Forum for Democracy and the Party for Freedom) didn't recommend illegal activities or ways to utilize the loopholes in Netherlands legislation. While multiple parties recommended the entrepreneur to spread the donation over multiple years, one party (50Plus) advised the donor to send the money in cash to a party employee. \n\n(1) https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/jaarverslagen\/2020\/10\/08\/overzichten-financiering-politieke-partijen-2019\n(2) https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/publicaties\/2021\/03\/10\/overzicht-giften-en-schulden-politieke-partijen-tweede-kamerverkiezingen-2021-van-2019-tot-en-met-24-februari-2021\n(3) https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/publicaties\/2019\/10\/25\/financiele-verslagen-over-2018-van-politieke-partijen\n(4) https:\/\/www.tweedekamer.nl\/kamerstukken\/brieven_regering\/detail?id=2020Z24956&did=2020D52401\n(5)https:\/\/www.telegraaf.nl\/nieuws\/2123264497\/politieke-partijen-open-voor-schimmige-donaties","evidence":[{"title":"Evidence 1","link":"https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/jaarverslagen\/2020\/10\/08\/overzichten-financiering-politieke-partijen-2019"},{"title":"Evidence 2","link":"https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/publicaties\/2021\/03\/10\/overzicht-giften-en-schulden-politieke-partijen-tweede-kamerverkiezingen-2021-van-2019-tot-en-met-24-februari-2021"},{"title":"Evidence 3","link":"https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/publicaties\/2019\/10\/25\/financiele-verslagen-over-2018-van-politieke-partijen"},{"title":"Evidence 4","link":"https:\/\/www.tweedekamer.nl\/kamerstukken\/brieven_regering\/detail?id=2020Z24956&did=2020D52401"},{"title":"Evidence 5","link":"https:\/\/www.telegraaf.nl\/nieuws\/2123264497\/politieke-partijen-open-voor-schimmige-donaties"}],"indicator_id":"A.PI.POLFIN","indicator_name":"Availability (PI): Political finance data","indicator_name_medium":"Political finance data","indicator_name_short":"Political finance","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.BREAKDOWN","subquestion_id":"241","subquestion_text":"Data contains details of donations, public funding, and membership dues for each party or candidate."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.INCOME","subquestion_id":"240","subquestion_text":"Data contains details of income for each party or candidate."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.AL","subquestion_id":"239","subquestion_text":"Data contains details of assets and liabilities of each party or candidate."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.SPEND","subquestion_id":"238","subquestion_text":"The data contains details of the spending of each party or candidate."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.INKIND","subquestion_id":"252","subquestion_text":"Data contains details of in kind and non-financial support donated to each party or candidate."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.DONATIONS","subquestion_id":"253","subquestion_text":"Data contains details of the timing and amounts of donations linked to donors."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.DONORNAME","subquestion_id":"254","subquestion_text":"Data contains first and last name for each donor."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.DONORS","subquestion_id":"255","subquestion_text":"Data contains detailed information about each donor, including place of residence, occupation, and employer."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e1.DONORID","subquestion_id":"256","subquestion_text":"Data includes unique identifiers for each donor."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.PI.POLFIN.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

There is one central platform, Tenderned, that publishes all tender announcements of market consultations, advance notices, contract notices, rectifications, and contract award notices (1). Tenderned is a public and open platform that also provides overviews of all tender announcements per half year in XML and accessible via an API. You can keep track of new tender announcements via an RSS API or email notifications.\nOften announcement platforms called Tsenders are used to publish information regarding announcements. In those cases a link is provided on Tenderned to the specific announcement and underlying documents. But many of these platforms are not open to the public and only accessible after registration with a unique company identifier (2). As a consequence much of the data regarding the first stages of a public procurement (planning, tendering) are not available to a broader audience. \n\nRegarding other categories of public procurement information. The ministry of Internal Affairs publishes an overview of all public contracts each 3 months as a PDF (3). Only the most recent overviews are published on this website and historical overviews and data is not available. In addition, no detailed public contract information (payments and transactions, timelines and progress updates, service delivery agreements, performance, etc.) is published in the Netherlands. Spend data and information is also only available in its most aggregated form. This means that annual overviews of which companies have received which contracts are available in CSV format. What makes this information hard to use is that instead of publishing the total or individual contract values per company, information is presented in gradient scales (4).\n\nIn respect to all public procurement phases the information and data that is provided (in whatever way) is incomplete e.g. missing data fields and\/or incorrect e.g. budgets and or contract values are not filled in correctly, reference numbers are missing, etc. For example, contract and tender values are \u20ac1 or \u20ac0,01 where these values are not correct. Desk research shows that in 2020 for 68% of all tenders no values or incorrect values of \u20ac1, \u20ac2, \u20ac3, \u20ac4 have been published (5). The aggregated contract data that is available consists of many empty data fields which makes the information hard to use for many purposes.  This is confirmed by research under various (re)users of public procurement data in the Netherlands (6).\n\n(1)

First of all, the Digitalisation Strategy. A large part of this strategy is about sharing and using data, for economic growth and  solving societal issues. A lot of the initiatives mentioned in this strategy are platforms and partnerships,  solicited by the government, which promote and encourage data reuse to improve products, services, et cetera. It promotes reuse by governments as well as economic sectors, health care et cetera. They have been extensively discussed under the third question of the Governance indicator. (1)\n\nThen there is NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government, which has also been discussed earlier. Three of it's five elements aim at improving society, transparency and public service through a data-driven way of working within government: 'solving societal issues with data-driven working' (element 1) , 'collecting and sharing knowledge about data-driven working' (element 4), and 'investing in people, organisation and culture change' (developing skills). (2) \n\nThird, there is the Action Plan Open Government 2020-2022. This action plan is carried out as part of the Netherlands' membership of the Open Government Partnership. It translates the government's vision on transparency and open data into concrete action points and projects. The Ministry of Interior Affairs, and the Learning and Expertise Point Open Government that the Ministry created, are responsible for the action plan. They assigned different governments, public organisations  and civil society organizations to carry out different elements of the plan. A lot of the action points focus on making data open and available, but some of them aim at improving and promoting the reuse of the data. Take for example, V.9 'Open Contract Register'. (3) Together with NGO Open State Foundation and the Chief State Procurement Officer, the ministry is developing an open procurement register, but this data is only valuable when it is being reused by government, companies and journalists, so they have carried out extensive research into the needs of different user groups. (4) Another example: the goal of VI.10 'Open Data Communities' is to match government data supply to the demand from different user groups (individuals, organisations, experts), and to teach them how to reuse data through these communities, by offering examples and the possibility to consult experts. The communities are realised through Data.government.nl. (5) \n\nData.government.nl  is the national data portal where all governments are encouraged to publish their datasets as open data, and where re-users can search and filter this data within different themes. It has been discussed extensively as part of earlier questions (f.i. the previous). The portal encourages data re-use by showcasing high-value data sets, impact stories and statistics, case studies and applications made with government data, et cetera. (6). Also, they host a growing number of data communities: groups of data owners, users and experts within a specific domain, like education, social security or energy. The communities offer in-depth information, specific data, reference data, applications and an opportunity to directly ask questions to experts. (7) Lastly, on it's support-page, Data.government.nl offers three types of information, on 'open data', 'publishing data' and 'using data'. The support for data use they offer consist of f.i. tips on how to search for datasets, information about different file formats in which the data is offered, and the possibility to admit requests for needed data when it is not yet available. (8)  \n\nFinally, there is PLOOI. In april 2021, Platform Open Government Information was launched. It is a portal where all public government documents can be searched. Here, everybody will be able to find the documents that will be made public under the new Open Government Act (Woo), when it enters into force. This portal (still a pilot for now), will make data more findable and therefore more reusable for citizens, companies and others that want to use government information. (9)\n\nWith regards to open data in particular, the Digitalisation Strategy discusses the importance of data reuse, and states that for good reuse, data should be open and linkable. That is why more and more government domains are adopting the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) principle and making data open by default. So companies and citizens can reuse and share the data as much as possible, in innovative ways. (10) The initiatives and platforms for sharing and using data that are discussed in this strategy, aim at open data just as well as non-open data. Second, an effort aimed specifically at open data, is the Stuiveling Open Data Awards: a yearly award for the initiative (business, science, journalism or whatever) that makes the best use of open government data. (11) \nThird, Data.government.nl of course, was developed especially to make sharing and re-use of open data possible. Furthermore, the projects and action points within the Action Plan Open Government are also all focussed on open data: both making it available and facilitating valuable reuse. \n\nThe government supports the reuse of data from different sources. The initiatives discussed in the Digitalisation Strategy (see third Governance-question),  focus not only on sharing data between governments and private sectors, but also between different private sectors. For example, an ecosystem has been set up so parties from the car and transport industry can share and use anonymised sensordata from hundreds of thousands of vehicles, which can be used by governments and road authorities to improve road safety. (12) Furthermore, there is incidental evidence of efforts to support crowdsourced data reuse, but it is not a structural effort that is reflected in the framework. For example, the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and Environment) uses 'citizens science' to conduct research into environment and health subjects. They have multiple projects, like 'farmers and neighbors', in which farmers and local residents of the municipality Venray measure air quality from their property for a year. The RIVM will use this data to develop solutions for a cattle farming that is durable and healthy with regards to pollution. (13) And the Data Sharing Coalition  is developing applications and use cases to use data from the 'smart meters' that measure energy consumption in people's homes, to offer consumers better support, like sustainability advice. (14) There is no evidence of the government promoting or supporting the use of data that originates from NGO's. \n\nGovernment efforts supporting data reuse, cover a  wide range of topics. The Digitalisation Strategy for example discusses energy and sustainability, transport, agriculture and environment, transport and mobility, health care and science. (15) The NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government is limited to reuse of data by governments, but covers topics like climate change, energy transition, safety and subversive crime, and all types of public service towards citizens. (16) On Data.government.nl, datasets are organised in seventeen different categories: governance, culture and recreation, economy, finances, housing, international, farming, migration and integration, nature and environment, education and science, public order and safety, law, space and infrastructure,  social security, traffic, work, health and health care. They host and support the following data communities: Data social security, Energy data, Mobility data, Education data, and Data from the migration chain. (17) The Action Plan Open Government is divided into seven thematic areas (with subtopics): Open Democracy, Open Information, Open Communication, Open Organisation, Open Procurement, Open Technology, Open Justice. (18) \n\nThe government strategy for data reuse aims at multiple user groups. For instance civil society organisations, who are included in the Action Plan Open Government as partners. (19) And Datagovernment.nl is also meant for civil society, as can be deduced from some of the impact stories that are showcased on the platform. (20) Furthermore, the government sometimes finances data reuse initiatives by civil society organisaties. For example, the Ministry of Interior Affairs financed the platform 'Where is my polling station': a website with an interactive map that Open State Foundation built by collecting and processing polling station data from every municipality in the country. (21) \nHowever, when it comes to civil society there is still a lot of potential reuse that does not receive attention or funding from the government. \n\nSecond, there are no specific support efforts focused on the media. But the Action Plan Open Government mentions journalists as a user group. For instance, it states that government procurement data should be open so journalists (amongst others) can research unfair practices and corruption. (22) Media and journalists also use data from the portal Data.government.nl. A lot of the submitted data requests that can be found on the platform come from journalists. And journalists also submit a lot of FOI-requests, but a lot of the Wob (Public Access to Government Information Act) requests take months, more often than not exceeding the allowed term. (23) This is where government efforts should be focussed. \n\nThird, the Action Plan Open Government mentions reuse by 'academics' multiple times. (24) However, Open Science and Open Access are not common practice in the Netherlands yet, and there is no widespread common policy stimulating data sharing and reuse in the science domain. Although, the Dutch Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), an independent government organisation, does promote and stimulate open science and data sharing in the domain. (25) And from interviews with journalists, that were held for example as part of the earlier mentioned research into users of open procurement data, we know that scientists can always submit datarequest with a government agency, which often result in the data being granted on the basis of a confidentiality agreement, when it is used for scientific purposes only. Furthermore, in 2020, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) was founded, which will become an open data portal and ecosystem  for data sharing and reuse in the science domain. (26) And agreements were made at a GOFAIR\/CODATA symposium, about data sharing and using for science, between regional clouds in Europe, Africa, the US, China and Australia. (27) \n\nThe Digitalisation Strategy (file attached), focuses largely on data re-use by private sectors, like agriculture, energy, transport and other businesses.  For instance, iSHARE is a collaboration between the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, which helps the transport and logistics sector improve efficiency and reduce costs and CO2-missions through sharing and using data, by connecting stakeholders in a trust framework. (28) The Open Government Action Plan also repeatedly recognizes the importance of open data for reuse by companies, and naturally, the data portal Data.overheid.nl is also aimed at private sectors. The impact stories, applications and case studies they showcase are mostly from private sectors. (29)\n\nAs shown above the government supports the reuse of data in different ways. For example, every once in a while the government organizes hackathons around a certain challenge. For example, in 2020, the Ministry of Economic Affairs organised a data-hackathon for the transport and logistics sector, to improve the matching of existing supply of digitisation to the needs of small businesses. (30) And the Accountability Hack has been organised multiple times, with the goal of solving certain government policy issues by developing a tool with the use of open data. (31) Plus, in July 2020, the University of Utrecht organized a hackthon for Data-trainees from the State I-Traineeship. The theme was COVID-19 and its effects on Dutch society. (32) Depending on the department or ministry, the government also organizes communication and community building efforts. The ministry of Defense for instance, does not, but the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, lately has really been pushed to organise public sessions to update interested parties on corona related data. And there are the mentioned Open Data Communities on Data.government.nl. There is also a community of programmers, CODE for NL, that organises training, appathons and meetups. CODE  for NL is not a government initiative, but the community sometimes contributes to government projects. For example, they contributed to an app that could help the Public Health Service (GGD) track contacts of people infected with the coronavirus, more efficiently. This was possible because the government opened up this ICT project to the public, so experts from different disciplines could contribute. (33)  Furthermore, there are government initiatives and organizations focussed on communication about using data. For example: Statistics Netherlands (CBS), organised an event about data use (for the 7th time), informing data users about different techniques and exchanging experiences, when they launched their data portal. (34) And Learning and Expertise Point Open Government organises events and meetups to bring stakeholders together.

supporting open data. Most of those discussed under the question above also encourage the availability and  open data. For example, NL DIGITAL Agenda Government, the main strategy when it comes to digitalisation and promoting data-driven work within governments. But the most important initiatives when it comes to making open data available and usable, are Forum Standardisation, a government advisory commission prescribing open standards for data publication (1), and the national open data portal, Data.government.nl. This is a platform where governments can publish and automatically update datasets or data catalogues, which also showcases examples of open data activities and impact. And through the support channel of the Data.government.nl portal, a handbook and other guidance can be found, helping government organisations with the publication of open data. There is also a forum and ways to contact them. (2)  Forum Standardisation offers guidance through prescribing technical publication standards for different types of data, and also helps governments take the necessary steps. (3) Learning and Expertise Point Open Government who offers roadmaps and toolkits for publishing open data and organizes knowledge and expertise sharing through meetups and events (4). \n\nThe Ministry of Interior affairs is responsible for digitalisation and data related initiatives. When it comes to publishing open data, the portal and database Data.government.nl is the most important. The portal is maintained by the Knowledge and Exploitation Centre for Official Government Publications (KOOP) on behalf of the Ministry (5). And the Ministry assigns the members of Forum Standardisation. This team is made up of experts from government organisations, businesses and science (6). Furthermore, the Ministry is behind the Learning and Expertise point Open Government, consisting of two team members (7). The Ministry also created the entity Digital Government, which is for instance responsible for Nl DIGITAL Data Agenda Government (8), and the Digital Government Board and CIO State Board (9).\n\nOpen data activities fall under 'Government services and information society' in the state budget.

In general, The Association of Netherlands Municipalities (VNG) concluded in 2020: \"In the field of open data policy, in municipalities most attention is paid to administrative active disclosure. The facilitating aspect of open data, such as data at the request of citizens, chain partners or stakeholders and the possibility of realising facilities together, generally receive less attention. (1) \n\nIn the field of open data policy, most attention in municipalities is paid to administrative\non administrative active disclosure. The facilitating aspect of open\ndata, such as data at the request of citizens, chain partners or stakeholders\nand the possibility of realising facilities together, generally receive less attention.\n\n\n\nA lot of provinces and a lot of bigger municipalities have open data initiatives. However, there are also lot's of (smaller) municipalities that do not have the budget or capacity to prioritise open data initiatives. VNG concluded, on the basis of another inventarisation, that there appear to be major differences between how municipalities deal with data and data platforms. (VNG, 'Managing data from the city' (in Dutch), file attached). It also really depends on the theme. For example some municipalities and waterboards offer lots of environmental and climate adaptation data, others offer more financial data.\n\nMany municipalities and provinces have some sort of data portal. For example: Utrecht (https:\/\/geo-point.provincie-utrecht.nl\/, province and  https:\/\/utrecht.dataplatform.nl\/#\/home, municipality), Amsterdam municipality (https:\/\/data.amsterdam.nl\/), Apeldoorn municipality ( https:\/\/www.apeldoorn.nl\/ter\/dataportaal), Province Zealand (https:\/\/dataportaal.zeeland.nl\/dataportaal\/srv\/dut\/catalog.search#\/home),  Province North Brabant  (https:\/\/data-portaal-noord-brabant.hub.arcgis.com\/pages\/open-data), municipality Nijmegen: https:\/\/opendata.nijmegen.nl\/, municipality Heemstede (https:\/\/gemeente-heemstede.opendata.arcgis.com\/), province South Holland (https:\/\/opendata.zuid-holland.nl\/geonetwork\/srv\/dut\/catalog.search#\/home), municipality Haarlem  (https:\/\/www.haarlem.nl\/opendata\/), municipality Arnhem (https:\/\/opendata.arnhem.nl\/), municipality The Hague (https:\/\/denhaag.dataplatform.nl\/#\/home), and water board Rijn en IJssel: https:\/\/opendata-wrij.opendata.arcgis.com\/. However, according to the Association of Municipalities Netherlands (VNG), there are big differences between these platforms. Some offer only open data, some don't, some data has user restrictions, some has not. Also, they offer data on different subjects. Some of them only offer GEO-data for example. The VNG has classified different types of platforms according to a scale (from open to closed, private to public, internal to external): closed data > virtual data warehouse > internal government data platform > municipal data platform > municipal data ecosystem. (2) \n\nThere are also concrete data projects. According to VNG, all municipalities now participate to some extent in data cooperation projects.  For example, the municipality of Eersel, has been working since 2016 on data-driven solutions for monitoring air quality, traffic and parking pressure, landscaping and water management. Some of the goals are saving energy and reducing CO2 emissions. And Helmond is carrying out 'smart city' initiatives, like the 'digital neighbourhood', for which data and open standards are used to secure interoperability of all services and systems. Data is offered as open data through a platform, in line with the municipalities open data principles. The municipality of Zwolle uses data to solve problems relating to transport, health and safety. In the Stadhagen neighbourhood, it worked with partners such as the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and Environment) and KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) on the Senshagen project, in which residents measured the effect of fireworks on air quality by fitting sensors to their homes. The data from this project is available as open data. Furthermore, the Province of Gelderland has developed the 'Statistical Pocketbook', the Province of Overijssel made a Statistics Database and the\nProvince of Utrecht a Ubase for tourism and culture. And examples of successful data cooperation at the national level are: Open Council Information and Open Polling Stations. (3)\n\nFurthermore, a lot of provinces and larger municipalities have data policies in the form of data strategies (of which open data is often a part), but not all smaller municipalities have the capacity or budget to develop such a policy, plus in a lot of localities there is just not much attention or priority on open data or data driven working yet. Examples of strategies: the North Holland datavision 2020-2025 (4), North Brabant datavision 2020-2025 (5), The Hague Data strategy 2020-2022 (6), and the Amsterdam data strategy 2021-2022 (7). Data strategies cover government information on all kinds of themes, that is shared with citizens and private sectors, as well as crowd sourced data that is used in smart city initiatives for example, and private sector data that governments are able to publish in their data portals through procurement. (8)\n\nActivities and facilities to share data (internally and externally) in municipalities, cities and provinces, are part of the larger local frameworks of data strategies and data portals. Because these were developed to solve certain societal issues and improve certain services, for which data sharing is vital. Municipalities or provinces achieve a 'data ecosystem', when there is a framework that ensures the circulation and sharing of data. For example, The municipality of Zwolle has an active policy on data use in the city to tackle social challenges, consisting of sharing data and using technology to solve problems related to transport, health and safety. (9) And the North Holland data strategy covers data sharing ('delen') and the necessary infrastructure as part of many action points. However, some local data policies do not mention sharing specifically. And there is no evidence of any local legal frameworks when it comes to data sharing. \n\nAlso, regarding policies for data publishing, there are big differences between provinces and municipalities. A lot of data portals work on a voluntary basis: some information is published , some is not, some data is open, some is not. A few data strategies and data portals really focus on consistent publication of more and more data, using open standards. However, even data portals from big municipalities often still contain very little data sets (f.i. Utrecht: 709). This shows there are no concrete rules or guidelines in place for consistent publication and management. \n\nIn terms of training civil servants on data literacy and skills, there is some evidence of local frameworks and initiatives.  For example, the municipality of Rotterdam has an internal program for stimulating data-driven working, which amongst other things focusses on civil servants data skills. (10) And the University of Utrecht created the Data School, a 'data work place', which connects regional and local governments to academic research about data. (11) However, many smaller municipalities don't prioritize data literacy or skills. Therefore, VNG has created the 'Development model for data-driven working for municipalities'. Municipalities can use it to check their 'data maturity'. (12) However, there is no guarantee that this model will actually be used by municipalities.  \n\nWith respect to support for data reuse, A lot of the data portals (see earlier questions for examples) offer some information for users, and for instance the municipality of Amsterdam, offers data services: API's that can be used to better link and search data (13), but there do not seem to be many local initiatives in this sphere.\n\nLastly, municipalities enable the impact of national facilities and systems by providing data to central government, provinces and\/or implementing organisations, for instance all the data for the ten basic registries of the country.\n\n\n(1) VNG, 'From open data to sharing data.

For the most part, government initiatives to train civil servants on data matters are laid down in NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government. The objective of this agenda is to promote the sharing, combining and analysis of data through cooperation between governments. The element consists of five elements, the last two of which are relevant here: 4. Collecting and sharing knowledge on working data-driven,  and 5. Investing in people, organisations and culture change'. (1) As part of number 4, the Learning and Expertise Center Data-driven working (LED) was set up. Here, best practices, methods and techniques and knowledge about data-driven working are collected and shared. (2) For example, they created the Data Governance Self-assessment tool, consisting of 43 questions on 8 themes, determining the position and ambition of a government organisation when it comes to data governance. Also, in 2020 LED launched the 'Toolkit Data-driven Working', with methods, techniques, prerequisites, best practices, case studies, interviews, tips from experts, information on ethical and legal aspects, et cetera. (3) Another example included in the Data Agenda Government, is the Den Bosch Data Week that the Ministry of Interior Affairs supports. This week is about showing government organisations and other target audiences what the social value of data can be. (4) Also, different knowledge conferences are organised by different government organisations. (5) \n\nElement 5 of the Data Agenda focuses on recruiting new talent, education, training and development of civil servants, setting up an infrastructure of datalabs and data science workspaces, promoting better data management, and changing the way of working within government organisations. For instance, government organisations are being encouraged to hire a Chief Data Officer and develop a data strategy, like more and more public bodies are doing. The Directorate CIO State is developing a blueprint for the role of Chief Data Officers. (6) Furthermore in 2019 the National Academy for Digitalisation and Computerisation in Government (RADIO) has launched an e-learning module on the impact and opportunities of digitisation for policy staff. They also organise different seminars, webinars, podcasts, e-learnings, access to Digi-Coaches, LinkedIn-groups, and courses to teach civil servants about data, cyber security, AI, digital skills, et cetera. (7) Also, in 2019 the government, together with the Technical University of Delft, started the Digicampus, where scientists, government bodies, businesses and citizens work together on digital government innovations to improve public service, including through use of data. (8) Furthermore, the Ministry of Interior Affairs and the Association of the Netherlands Municipalities, are developing international framework guidelines for responsible data use, through the working group 'Data Driven Public Sector' of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is chaired by the Netherlands. (9) For more examples, see the NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government (file attached). \n\nAdditionally, there's the Learning and Expertise Point Open Government, which is focussed on sharing knowledge and experiences when it comes to open data. They offer tools and instruments and bring civil servants in contact with experts. For example, through the project 'Breakthrough with Open Data', open data relays were organised, where NGOs, governments and other stakeholders came together to solve social issues with data. Furthermore, they offer an Open Data Toolkit, with i.e. a roadmap and practical tips to get started with open data. (10) \n\nLastly, the national data platform, Data.government.nl, offers open data knowledge and technical support. For example through the Open Data Guide, that civil servants can use to achieve open data within their organisation.

(1) On December 27th, 2020, the Act implementing registration of ultimate beneficial owners of legal entities (Implementatiewet registratie uiteindelijke belanghebbenden) came into force. This act amends the 2007 Trade Register Act (Handelsregisterwet), the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act (Wwft) and a number of other laws relating to the obligation to have, maintain and centrally register information about ultimate beneficial owners ('ultimate beneficial owners', abbreviated UBOs) of companies and other legal entities incorporated in the Netherlands. (2) \n\nThis Implementation Act has set up an UBO-register, by adding paragraph d to article 2 of the Hrw 2007, which entered into force in January 2020. (3) This paragraph states there should be a register with 'ultimate beneficiaries to prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing'. For the definition of an UBO, article 1 paragraph 1 of the Hrw 2007 refers to article 10a paragraph 1 of the Wwft. (4) An UBO is the owner of a company (someone who owns more that 25% of shares or voting rights), or someone who is effectively in control of a company. (5) The obligation to publish the data, lies with the KvK, and is set out in Chapter 4 ('The provision and use of data') of the Hrw 2007, mostly in articles 21 and 22. Limitations to this obligation may be set by General Administrative Order (AMvB), to protect the privacy of persons who are registered in the register (article 23 of the Hrw 2007). Type of entities that are not required to register themselves through the UBO register are sole proprietorships, listed BV's and NV's,100% subsidiaries of listed companies, owners associations, associations with limited legal capacity that do not run a business, legal entities in formation legal entities under public law, other legal entities under private law, including historical legal entities (such as guilds and almshouses). (6)\n\nThere is no legal requirement for published company data, including UBO-data, to contain 'open data', in the sense that it's free of charge, free of rights, and machine readable for instance. However, the fourth EU Directive for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, and the Hrw 2007, do require the data to be available to the general public (albeit through pay or registration barriers). (7) So the KvK publishes it online, and provides an API to search through it, but to access the data users need to register and pay a fee of 2,50 per extract. (9) The quality of the data is secured through a 'terugmeldplicht' (feedback obligation) laid down in the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (Wwft), Article 10b, paragraph 2. Wwft institutions and competent authorities are obliged to report back if UBO data is incorrect. You can report the following: missing UBOs in the UBO register; persons who are incorrectly listed in the UBO register; or an incorrect interest or extent of the interest of a UBO. (9) Additionally, Chapter 7 of the Hrw 2007 is dedicated to quality control. Article 41 states that on the basis of Article 393 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the information in de company register is verified by an accountant once every three years.  (10) Article 40 of the Hrw 2007 requires that the data is accurate, complete and regularly updated.

accessible. However, from September 23rd 2020, the entire government is legally required to offer all information and services in a digitally accessible way, meaning people with a functional impairment can use them as easily as people without a disability. (1) According to Article 3 of the Temporary Decree on Digital Accessibility for Government, public authorities must make their websites and mobile applications accessible by applying the standard EN 301 549, except if and in so far as this would impose 'a disproportionate burden'. Whether such a burden exists, depends on financial resources of the government organisation and the estimated costs and benefits to the public authority concerned in relation to the estimated benefits to persons with disabilities. The requirement entails that all government websites, including websites that were commissioned by the government, and all the information on these platforms, need to have an 'accessibility statements'. (2)\n\nWith the Decree of Digital Accessibility for Government, the Web Accessibility Directive (Directive (EU) 2016\/21\/02) has been implemented. This directive requires \"an accessibility statement for each website and mobile app; a feedback mechanism so users can flag accessibility problems or request information published in a non-accessible content; regular monitoring of public sector websites and apps by Member States, and reporting on the results.\" (3) The monitoring is performed within government-bodies, through inter-governmental supervision by provinces and ministries. They share their findings with Logius (from the Ministry of Interior Affairs), who reports yearly to the House of Representatives and every three years to the European Commission. Logius also helps public bodies achieve accessibility, for instance with the handbook they published. This handbook explains, amongst other things, what should be included in the accessibility statement. The Ministry of Interior Affairs has developed a model for this statement, 'Digitoegankelijk', based on the model that the European Commission established: the EN 301 549 norm, which uses the technical standard WCAG 2.1. WCAG 2.1 was developed by the W3C and is the global standard for web accessibility. The statement should (amongst other things) include whether research has been conducted yet (which has to be done following the WCAG-EM method or an equivalent documented evaluation method for the WCAG 2.1-standard), and if so whether this research shows complete compliance. (4) \n\nAnother ground for offering information in an inclusive and accessible manner, is the 'Equal treatment on the grounds of disability or chronic illness act', which has been in force since 2003. This act determines that no one can be excluded because of their disability, neither offline nor digitally. It applies to education, labor and transport, as well as products and services (data). (5) Furthermore, the accessibility requirement will be laid down in the Digital Governance Act, which (due to pending adjustments) will not be in force for at least another year.

Through the Digital Government Act, the use of open standards will become mandatory, but due to a pending legislative amendment, the law will not be implemented until at least juli 2022. (1) Currently the Government Information Reusability Act ('Wet herbruikbaarheid overheidsinformatie') dictates that all public information should, when requested be provided 'the way it is available at the government agency' (so in raw form), and 'as much as possible' in an open and machine-readable format, according to formal standards. So this is just a 'best effort'-rule, plus this act only applies to information that is requested, so the rule does not apply to active publishing of information. (2) However, there are some laws and quality frameworks (with force of law) that cover the ten national basic registers ('basisregistraties'), like the Trade Register and the Personal Records Database. These differ per register and will be discussed further below. \n\nIn addition, data management, standards and quality are addressed in the Dutch Digitalisation Strategy. (3) And it is part of the third element of the NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government, which is called 'Improving the quality of government data and using it more efficiently'. The strategy and the agenda describe different programs and initiatives aimed at publishing and managing data in a better way. For example, promoting the adoption of the FAIR principles (Findable,Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) within different government domains. As a result, data from different organizations and standards can be better combined. (4) Also, the Ministry of Interior Affairs has set up an advisory committee consisting of experts from various government organisations, the economic sector and science world, called Forum Standardisation. This committee tests and prescribes open standards for publishing data to government organisations. Through two lists (which have no force of law), called 'recommended' standards and 'apply-or-justify'-standards, they prescribe different standards for different types of data (f.i.: CSV for numeric table files). (5) \n\nFurthermore, Data.government.nl (data.overheid.nl) is a platform and API  where all governments can and are encouraged to publish open datasets (so far there are 16.013 available sets). In accordance with the DCAT-model, different file formats are allowed, like JSON, RDF, HTML, etc. (6) Lastly, an important initiative is the program plan for the improvement of the system of basic registers. Data from these registers is being used more than 40 million times a day, for instance by governments when they grant licenses or subsidies, but also by citizens and companies when navigating to an address or looking up house prices. In the system, data from the different registers is linked to each other. The program addresses access to and correction of data,  re-use of data and quality management. (7)  \n\nThere is no legal framework setting obligations when it comes to publishing metadata. However, when government organisations want to publish their data catalogues on Data.government.nl, the data has to conform to the DCAT-AP-DONL standard for metadata, which makes it possible to link datasets.  DCAT-AP-DONL is a  version of W3C's international standards, developed by Data.government.nl. (8) To prevent users from having to visit all individual catalogues, metadata is collected from various regional, national and thematic catalogues. To standardise the exchange of metadata between catalogues, the DCAT standard was developed. The interoperability between catalogues makes single entry and repeated use possible. This standard has not yet been labeled by Forum Standardisation as 'recommended' or 'apply-or-justify' (its status is still pending), but it soon will be. (9)  On Data.overheid.nl it is also mandatory to add a unique identifier for each dataset as metadata. (10) Forum Standardisation's lists do contain other metadata standards, for other types of data as well. For example, according to the Forum, OWMS should be used to describe 'information objects' that the government publishes on the Internet, such as articles, parliamentary papers, announcements and forms. (11) \n\n\nThere is no general legal framework setting rules for quality control of government data. And there are no quality norms that apply to all basic registries. However, the ten national basic registers all have certain norms that should be met, some of which  are laid down in the law by which they were created or additional quality frameworks. For instance, the Basic Register Income (BRI), which contains the salaries of 14 million citizens, has to conform to a set of quality rules. An example of a norm is that they should be 99% complete and accurate. The quality norms for the other registers, and research determining to which extent they are met, can be found in the government report 'Quality information system of basic registrations' and in the answers to other indicators (f.i. the Trade Register is dealt with under company information). (12) \n\nAlso, quality is secured to feedback procedures. Registries and databases from individual government organisations can have different rules or procedures for feedback, they are not subjected to any central legal obligation, (13) but this is different for the national basic registers. Firstly, in 2020 a contact point was set up where errors in the basic registers can be reported. (14) And these registers are all subject to a feedback obligation ('terugmeldplicht'), meaning the users of the data (mostly other government bodies) are legally obligated to report discrepancies. In 2018 for example, 110.000 reports were filed. (15) For example, the feedback obligation regarding UBO-data (from the Trade Register) is  laid down in the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (Wwft), Article 10b, paragraph 2. Wwft institutions and competent authorities are obliged to report back if UBO data is incorrect.  (16) And Article 7n of the Cadastre Act states that 'An administrative body shall report to the Service, stating reasons, its reasonable doubt about the accuracy of a data entry in the land register which has been designated as authentic by virtue of this Act.' (17) Each basic register has a different legal base with a feedback obligation. \n\n(1) Digitale Overheid, 'Wet digitale overheid', \u200b\u200bhttps:\/\/www.digitaleoverheid.nl\/overzicht-van-alle-onderwerpen\/wetgeving\/wet-digitale-overheid\/. \n(2) Wet hergebruik van overheidsinformatie, 2015,  Hoofdstuk III: Ter beschikking stellen van informatie voor hergebruik, article 5, https:\/\/wetten.overheid.nl\/BWBR0036795\/2016-10-01 \n(3) Rijksoverheid, 'Nederlandse digitaliseringsstrategie 2021', p. \u2026 (file attached). \n(4) NL DIGITAAL: Data Agenda Overheid, 'Overheidsdata kwalitatief verbeteren en effici\u00ebnter benutten', https:\/\/www.digitaleoverheid.nl\/overzicht-van-alle-onderwerpen\/nieuwe-technologieen-data-en-ethiek\/data-agenda-overheid\/overheidsdata-kwalitatief-verbeteren-en-efficienter-benutten\/.  \n(5) Forum Standaardisatie,  https:\/\/www.forumstandaardisatie.nl\/.\n(6) Data.overheid.nl, 'Publicatie van datasets op data.overheid.nl', https:\/\/data.overheid.nl\/ondersteuning\/data-publiceren\/datasets-publiceren, and 'Dataset aanmelden: keuze uit bestandsformaten', https:\/\/data.overheid.nl\/bestandsformaten-open-data. \n(7) Digitale Overheid, 'Stelsel van basisregistraties krijgt versterking', https:\/\/www.digitaleoverheid.nl\/achtergrondartikelen\/samen-investeren-in-verbetering-datakwaliteit-gebruik-en-dienstverlening\/, and (1) Rijksoverheid, 'Nederlandse digitaliseringsstrategie 2021', p. 39-40 (file attached). \n(8) Data.overheid.nl, 'Publicatie van datasets op data.overheid.nl', https:\/\/data.overheid.nl\/ondersteuning\/data-publiceren\/datasets-publiceren. \n(9) Forum Standaardisatie, 'DCAT-AP-DONL', https:\/\/www.forumstandaardisatie.nl\/open-standaarden\/dcat-ap-donl. \n(10)  Data.overheid.nl, 'Publicatie van datasets op data.overheid.nl', https:\/\/data.overheid.nl\/ondersteuning\/data-publiceren\/datasets-publiceren. \n(11) Forum Standaardisatie, 'OWMS', https:\/\/www.forumstandaardisatie.nl\/open-standaarden\/owms. \n(12)  Basisregistraties, ICTU & het Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties, 'Kwaliteitsinformatie Stelsel van Basisregistraties', April 16th 2020 (file attached).\n(13) Digitale overheid, 'Stelsel van basisregistraties.

There is no legal framework for data sharing. Governments and companies are free to come up with their own conditions for data sharing (apart from the data that must be available as open data or on the basis of FOI requests, but these types were discussed in the previous questions). However, there exist partnerships and data sharing initiatives and platforms for data sharing by governments, and for cross-sector data sharing between companies, in various sectors, such as healthcare and transport . These come mainly from the government and a lot of them are mentioned in the Dutch Digitalisation Strategy 2021. An important part of the framework is the program and interdepartmental steering committee Control over Data ('Regie op gegevens'). The committee formed a legal working group that developed proposals for statutory regulation of the sharing of data from government registries with citizens, companies, third parties and private service providers. These proposals will eventually be implemented in the Digital Government Act, which will lay the legal foundation for a basic infrastructure for data sharing and the mandatory use of open standards, but which is not yet in force. (4)\n\nWhen it comes to data sharing between companies, the government's approach consists of supporting promising initiatives, investigating whether and where regulation is needed, and promoting the development of insights, tools and exchanges of knowledge that could contribute to effective data sharing. (5) For instance, the government has recently  published a report in which the role of data in the tech sector is investigated, in order to explore the possibilities and risks of mandatory data sharing. (6) As part of the Digitalisation Strategy, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy published the 'Dutch vision on data sharing between businesses', in which it discusses three principles that are central to the government's approach: 'voluntary data sharing is preferable', 'data sharing will be made compulsory, if necessary', and 'people and businesses retain control of their data'. The document also discusses how the government is planning on implementing this vision.(7) \n\nIn order to stimulate voluntary cross-sectoral data sharing and to come to agreements on this, a group of data sharing initiatives, industries, companies and knowledge institutions were brought together in an open collaboration for cross-sectoral data sharing, the Data Sharing Coalition (DSC), at the Cabinet's initiative in 2019. The government supports this coalition, so that pilot projects to share data between different sectors can be carried out. The goal is to create better interoperability between  existing - often sector-specific - data-sharing initiatives, which requires agreements on f.i. technical standards, data semantics, legal agreements and reliable, reusable digital identities. (8) As of April 2021, the coalition consists of 38 participating organisations and companies. The initiative  is not limited to Dutch borders and is open to participants from all countries. (9) \n\nIn 2018 the Ministry of Economic Affairs conducted research into many data sharing platforms and initiatives, exploring the possibilities for a system of agreements on data sharing, to fill the gaps in the existing infrastructure of initiatives. (10) Among these initiatives are 'data trusts'. These make it easier for individual parties, including consumers and businesses, to agree on conditions for data access and data sharing that adequately safeguard their interests, which is especially needed when companies with strong negotiating power are involved. Examples of these trusts in different sectors  include IRMA, Qiy, Medmij, iSHARE, JOINDATA and OCKTO. All of them ensure a trusted way of sharing data by properly securing the various interests, thereby making it possible to use the data for economic and social purposes. (11) For instance, iSHARE is a collaboration between the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, that helps the transport and logistics sector improve efficiency and reduce costs and CO2-missions, by connecting stakeholders in a trust framework. All participants can decide what they want to share and with whom, following generic agreements and standards that were developed for the sector. (12) With regard to the same sector, the Digital Transport Strategy was developed, to get to 'digital by default'.  From 2025, the 'Basic Data Infrastructure' will enable decentralised data sharing between different companies and governments for all forms of transport. (13) Furthermore, from 2018 to 2020  the Ministry of Infrastructure had conducted research into 'smart mobility'. To allow increasingly automated and digitalised vehicles to operate smoothly and safely, the National Mobility Data Access Point is being launched, to centralize and open up data on road traffic and multimodal travel information. (14)\n\nExamples from the tech and transport sector have been mentioned, but their are also frameworks for other sectors, like health care, agriculture, and energy. For instance, because not all hospitals have means to exchange data (radiological images, laboratory results, etc.) between hospitals, which is important when patients are being dispersed due to the pandemic, the COVID-19 Portal from Philips has been recommended to hospitals as a temporary solution. (15). As for agriculture: farmers are producing more and more data and their machines are increasingly digitally connected. This creates opportunities to produce more efficiently, for example through (self-learning) algorithms and the use of robots,  in the field, in logistics and in product processing. However, farmers find that they have little control over the use of and access to the data they generate. This way data sharing  can affect privacy, autonomy, economic position and market power. To give farmers more control and security, the Top Sector programme Precision Farming 4.0 is working on an infrastructure for sharing agrodata, the Agricultural Data Facility. (16) As far as the energy sector is concerned, the Data Sharing Coalition is currently developing a use case where consumers can use their energy data to understand the potential for energy-saving measures (like thermal pumps or solar panels) in their specific household. Also, a proposal for the new Energy Act (implementing the EU Electricity Directive) is being prepared. This legislation should improve the cooperation in the chain of measuring data, the availability of high quality and high frequency data and the access to and sharing of data. (17) However, in the consultation that was held, and advisory body states that is is impossible to determine the effectiveness of the law, because the obligations have not been sufficiently elaborated. (18) \n\nThe (examples of) frameworks above focus on data sharing between companies and between government and companies. For data-sharing within the government, there is no central, legal framework either. Governmental organisations may draw up their own policy documents, terms of use and licences with regard to data. For instance, the Chamber of Commerce limits the use of company information, the Land Registry manages land data that is partly public and partly closed due to privacy issues, and KNMI shares almost all weather information. However, data sharing within the government is covered by the Dutch Digitalisation Strategy. An important part of the framework is the NL DIGITAL: Data Agenda Government, which focuses on solving social problems with data, stimulating data-driven work by government organisations, sharing data and improving data-quality. (19)  To further stimulate data-driven work on societal issues, the government has developed infrastructures to bring together knowledge, skills, technical infrastructure and data in data labs. Like the CBS (statistics) data ecosystem, the police information organisation, different departmental data labs and the Regional and National Information and Expertise Centres. (20) Also, the government conducts FAIR data pilots. For example, the Drought & Flooding pilot project aims to make water quantity data from water boards and the national water authority FAIR at the source, to obtain overview and better manage water in periods of drought or extreme rainfall. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management stand for: Findability, Accesibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. (21) Furthermore, for government organizations there's Pleio: an open source collaboration platform for knowledge sharing between  government organizations. (22) Lastly, the Association of Netherlands Municipalities has formulated the Principles for the Digital Society, in order to set an example for the business community and show them the frameworks that local governments set with regard to data collection and use. These principles (f.i. 'data is open by default' and 'initiatives should serve the common good as much as possible') are translated at the national level into government-wide principles. (23) \n\nFinally, data sharing in the Netherlands is affected by the European framework. However, for a large part this framework is still being developed and not yet in force. The European Strategy for Data aims at creating a single market for data. Amongst other things, it intends to 'adopt legislative measures on data governance, access and reuse. For example, for business-to-government data sharing for the public interest' and '\u200b\u200bmake data more widely available by opening up high-value publicly held datasets across the EU and allowing their reuse for free'. (24) And in November 2020, the European Commission published a proposal for the Data Governance Act, which aims to improve the availability of data in the EU by developing a framework for public data sharing and increasing trust in data intermediaries, and by strengthening data sharing mechanisms in the EU, for instance by lowering transaction costs of B2B and C2B data sharing. However, it remains to be seen what form the final law will take. (25) Furthermore, initiatives are being taken at the EU level. For instance, the European Data for Road Safety trial, which was successfully completed and thus scaled up to a permanent exchange. Under Dutch chairmanship, a data ecosystem has been set up with member states and industry parties in which anonymous sensor data from hundreds of thousands of vehicles is shared with governments and road authorities to prevent unsafe situations and to detect and share information with drivers. (26) And for the science domain, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) was established. In December 2020, agreements were ratified on data sharing for scientific research between regional clouds in Europe, Africa, the US, China and Australia: the FAIR Digital Object21 agreements. These form the basis for a Web of FAIR Data & Service.

2016\/679)(GDPR, AVG in Dutch), which has direct effect in all EU-countries, and the Dutch General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act (GDPRIA, UAVG in Dutch). The GDPR applies to the processing of all personal data (Article 2). The definitions of data 'controllers' and 'processors' cover all private and public sectors. (1) \n\nChapter 6 of the GDPR dictates that each member state should have an independent supervisory authority ensuring and monitoring the application of the regulation, 'in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union' (Article 51, 52). Among other things, this authority monitors data protection, advises legislative and administrative government bodies, and handles complaints lodged by data subjects, organizations or others (Article 57(1.f)(2)). The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) is called the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens. The mentioned fundamental rights are Article 8 European Convention on Human Rights and Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental rights. (2)\n\nData processors (when they are a public body, or when processing data is their main activity or they do it on a large scale) need to appoint a data protection officer, who registers with and reports to the national authority, and is responsible for GDPR-compliance. This is implemented thorugh the GDPRIA. (3) Furthermore, Article 68 of the GDPR established the European Data Protection Board, which is composed of the heads of the supervisory authority of member states. It is responsible for the consistent application of the DDPR. It's tasks consist of monitoring, advising the EU Commission, and issuing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for data processors, governments and supervisory authorities (Article 70 GDPR). Also it issues opinions when national authorities take certain measures and settles disputes between or within national authorities (Articles 64 & 65). (4)\n\nArticle 77 of the GDPR gives data subjects the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and Article 78 contains the right to an effective judicial remedy against this supervisory authority. Article 79 adds a right to an effective judicial remedy against a data controller or processor. Together these articles ensure an effective right to redress. (5) \n\nData controllers have to comply with the core principles and responsibilities set out in article 5 GDPR. I.a. taking steps to ensure personal information is updated and accurate; limiting access to personal data in accordance with its intended use; only transferring data to third-parties if there are assurances they will also respect data protection rights; destroying or anonymising data after it is no longer needed for its original intended use. The Controller is responsible for ensuring third parties comply to the principles as well (Article 5 Paragraph 2, and Article 4, Paragraph 1). Rules related to  transferring of data are set out in Chapter 5. (6) \n\nData controllers and processors must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to existing security  risks (Article 32 GDPR). The GDPR requires a personal data breach to be notified, without undue delay (max. 72 hours) by the controller to its supervisory authority, and for more serious breaches to be notified to the affected data subjects as well (Article 33 & 34). Article 4 defines a data breach as a 'breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed'. (7) \n\nThe framework contains specific rules covering algorithmic decision-making. To 'ensure fair and transparent processing', the controller has to provide a data subject with (access to) information on the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject (Article 13(2.f), 14(2.g) and 15(1.h) GDPR). Article 22 GDPR formulates a prohibition on fully automated individual decision-making that is based on profiling, if it has a legal or otherwise significant impact on the data subject. (8) According to the Dutch DPA, this means: 'important decisions should not be made by an algorithm alone, without human intervention'. (9) However, Article 22 provides three exceptions. Automated decision making is allowed when it is: necessary for entering into or performing a contract, authorized by EU or Member State law, or the data subject has given their explicit (opt-in) consent. When decisions are taken on the basis of the first and second option, the data subject also has the right to obtain human intervention, to contest the decision, and to express his or her point of view. The Dutch DPA has used the second option to implement exceptions to the prohibition in Article 40 of the GDPRIA, which states that the GDPR does not apply if the automated individual decision-making, other than based on profiling, is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. (10) So for instance when awarding study or child allowances. (11)\n\nThe GDPR does not contain specific rules on location data, but it does consider this to be personal information, so as long as it is not anonymized is falls under the protection of the regulation. The ePrivacy Directive (Directive (EU) 2002\/58\/EC), which will soon be replaced by the e-privacy directive, handles data protection in the context of telecommunication, so it protects location data related to users' terminal equipment. (12) Also, the European Data Protection Board that oversees the GDPR implementation, on the 21ste of April 2021, issued guidelines (on the basis of Article 70(1.e) GDPR), for the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It has developed rules on the data, the purpose of use, security, et cetera. However, the guidelines are not binding. (13) \n\nNo other additions or changes to the legal framework have been made. However, in March 2020 the Dutch DPA announced it would be making some adjustments to its approach, in light of Covid-19. They wrote that the DPA is \"giving governments and companies room to focus on combating corona during the corona crisis. For example, organizations will be given more time to respond to questions from the AP where necessary, and the DPA will give initiatives to protect public health plenty of room. But the regulator will continue to intervene where privacy is truly at risk.\" For example, they allow some  health care facillities that do not have a way to make secure video calls to patient, to use consumer apps like FaceTime or Skype.

Article 14 of this law dictates that all archival records should be open to the public, free of charge, and that reuse of the information (both copying and altering) should be allowed. Article 15 contains a few justifications that allow (limited) restriction of public access, namely respect for privacy, the interest of the State or its allies, or preventing disproportionate advantage of disadvantage of persons or organizations. (1) When citizens want to access information that is not available in any archive or for instance on government websites, they can submit an information request based on the Public Access to Government Information Act (Wet openbaarheid van bestuur, Wob). A data request must in principle be granted, unless one of the grounds for exception from articles 10 and 11 apply. These include for example protecting company and manufacturing data or someone's right to privacy. (2)\n\nArticle 6 of the Wob determines that a request should be handled 'as soon as possible' and no later than four weeks after it is received. In practice however, a large part of request exceeds this term. A report from independent research agency SEO, shows that over the last few years, the duration of processing a request has increased annually. (3) Furthermore requests, decisions and provided data are not regularly or consistently published. The laws contain no rules that enforce centralized publication. (4) Therefore, Open State Foundation, as a civil society organization, has created OpenWob.nl, where all public Wob-related documents are collected and made searchable. (5) Another problem with the Wob is that it does not impose an obligation of active disclosure. Also, there exists no independent oversight body that inspects the compliance of governments with the Wob and where requesters can lodge complaints. That is why in 2016, the House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer) adopted a proposal for a law replacing the Wob: the Open Government Act (Wet openbaarheid van bestuur), which will instate an obligation of proactive disclosure of (some) government information. This proposal was amended in February 2021. The prospect is that the law will establish an 'advisory commission for transparency and information management' and central platform for all disclosed information. (6) The current proposal also has a broader scope than the Wob, which applies in particular to administrative bodies such as ministries, municipalities and provinces. (7) Pursuant to Article 2.2, the provisions of the Woo will also apply to legislative and judicial bodies, like the Senate and House of Representatives, the Council of the Judiciary, parts of the Council of State, the Court of Audit, the National Ombudsman and boards of public bodies. (8) However, the Woo still needs to be adopted by the Senate (Eerste Kamer), so the precise content and scope remains uncertain. \n\nThe Wob and Woo do not mention reusability: this topic is governed by the Government Information Reusability Act (Wet herbruikbaarheid overheidinformatie, Who). The Who implements the EU Public Sector Information Directive and is therefore focused on the reuse of data for developing and improving products and services. (9) According to article 5 of the Who, all public information should, when requested (so not actively), be provided 'the way it is available at the government agency' (so in raw form), and 'as much as possible' in an open and machine-readable format: a 'best effort'-rule. (10) \n\nNone of the abovementioned acts contain a definition of 'open data'. However, the official government open data platform provides guidelines the required characteristics of open data. These guidelines were established on June 22nd 2016, in a letter that the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations sent to the House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer). The eight guidelines state that open data must be: published pro-actively (unless exceptions from the Woo or Who apply), free of charge, exempt from third party rights, accessible without registration, machine readable, provided with metadata in accordance with the DCAT-AP standard, and as complete and unedited as possible. These requirements lack any force of law.

Ministries are responsible for their own budget chapter and defend their budgets in parliament. Policy implementation is largely mandated or delegated to departmental agencies and autonomous administrative agencies. Regional and local governments are separate and largely autonomous tiers of government. Due to this, different laws, regulations, policies in place in the Netherlands in regard to the regulation of public finance. The 'Comptabiliteitswet 2016' e.g. Accounts Act requires that the national government publishes pre-budget statements, the executive budget, proposal and supporting documents, the enacted budget, a citizen budget, in-year reports in budget success and execution, mid-year reviews, a year-end report and an audit report (1) Each year the Minister of Finance defines the 'Rijksbegrotingsvoorschriften' e.g. annual regulations (2). It  regulates the reporting requirements and the procedural matters of central government budgets, accounts and documents to be provided to the States General. It provides models for the publication of the financial data by each ministry and includes 5 specific models for the publication of certain financial information as open data. The open data does not fall under the official documents for the budget and the annual report and is not checked by the Central Government Audit Service. For internal financial management all ministries use a central and automated software system called RIS-IBOS. In this system data is structured and categorised, inter alia using the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010). Through this system data is shared with the Central Bureau for Statistics and the European Commission (3).\n\nRegarding the verification of this information, The Court of Audit investigates whether the central government spends public money wisely, economically and carefully. Their statutory task is to monitor central government income and expenditure and to report on this to parliament once a year on Accountability Day (third Wednesday in May). Based on their opinion, parliament can decide whether to grant discharge to the cabinet. In addition, they report individual investigations to parliament so that MPs can determine whether a minister's policy is effective (1).\n\nThere is no a framework that supports the disclosure of level at its most detailed level e.g. transactions, nor real-time publication. For all types of financial data different updates are required e.g. for in-year reports every month, for budgets each year, etc. (4).\n\n(1) https:\/\/wetten.overheid.nl\/BWBR0039429\/2021-02-13\n(2) https:\/\/rbv.rijksfinancien.nl\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf\/Rijksbegrotingsvoorschriften%202021.pdf\n(3) https:\/\/wettenpocket.overheid.nl\/portal\/0ff0f42b-2a70-45b7-a9c9-3b4253b292e7\/document\/Handleiding%20dataverkeer%20RIS-IBOS_20171218.pdf\n(4) https:\/\/wettenpocket.overheid.nl\/portal\/7ec1a250-bb0b-4d72-929e-d270ddae2817\/document\/bijlage-3-memorie-van-toelichting-comptabiliteitswet-2016.pdf","evidence":[{"title":"Evidence 1","link":"https:\/\/wetten.overheid.nl\/BWBR0039429\/2021-02-13"},{"title":"Evidence 2","link":"https:\/\/rbv.rijksfinancien.nl\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf\/Rijksbegrotingsvoorschriften%202021.pdf"},{"title":"Evidence 3","link":"https:\/\/wettenpocket.overheid.nl\/portal\/0ff0f42b-2a70-45b7-a9c9-3b4253b292e7\/document\/Handleiding%20dataverkeer%20RIS-IBOS_20171218.pdf"},{"title":"Evidence 4","link":"https:\/\/wettenpocket.overheid.nl\/portal\/7ec1a250-bb0b-4d72-929e-d270ddae2817\/document\/bijlage-3-memorie-van-toelichting-comptabiliteitswet-2016.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE","indicator_name":"Governance (PF): Public finance data","indicator_name_medium":"Public finance frameworks","indicator_name_short":"Public finance frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"7","response_text":"They exist and are operational.","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"12","response_text":"Requirements to publish data are set out in binding policy, regulations, or law.","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e1.SUMMARY","subquestion_id":"37","subquestion_text":"Summary reports must be provided as structured data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e1.TRANSACTIONS","subquestion_id":"39","subquestion_text":"Expenditure information at the most disaggregated level of the economic classification must be provided as structured data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e1.EXECBUDGET","subquestion_id":"40","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require executive budget proposal information to be provided as structured data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e1.ENACTED","subquestion_id":"31","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require the approved or enacted budget to be provided as structured data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e1.INYEAR","subquestion_id":"44","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require in-year reports as structured data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e1.YER","subquestion_id":"43","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require year-end reports as structured data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e3.TIMELY","subquestion_id":"17","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require that data is regularly updated."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."},{"response_id":"110","response_text":"They cover one or more central government agencies, but there are similar rules\/guidance that apply to many other agencies and\/or local government units.","varname":"G.PF.PUB-FINANCE.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"46","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive is the coverage of laws, regulations, policies, or guidance assessed for this question?"}]},{"score":"4","justification":"The Ambtenarenwet 2017 e.g. the Civil Servants Act 2017 prescribes that the ancillary functions and interests of civil servants should be publicly disclosed if disclosure is necessary to protect the integrity of public service (1).

Even though there are no legal obligations to do so, public consultations are organised frequently by ministries and regulatory agencies to publish proposed regulations, anticipated regulatory changes. This is the result of the position of the Dutch cabinet on internet consultation legislation (2). This position states that the government considers internet consultation a useful instrument as a supplement to the already existing consultation practice in the legislative process.  This cabinet's position from 2011 expresses the wish to continue the consultation experiment and provides certain non-binding conditions and principles for the use of internet consultations:  a minimum duration of a public consultation of 4 weeks, clear and comprehensible explanation of the content of the proposal, the aim and the expected effects for the target groups need to be provided, which issues are up for public consultation and which not, that citizens, companies and institutions are drawn as much as possible to consultations on proposals that may affect them, public reactions to consultations are only made public if the individual or organisations responsible agree to this and that after a decision by cabinet a summary of the results of the consultation are published. In practice however the noncommittal character of this position is prominent. For example, the public consultation period regarding controversial proposed legislation that makes it possible for NCTV terrorism coordinator to follow citizens online was only a couple days instead of the suggested 4 weeks (3). To this date this experimentation phase is still ongoing and there do not seem to be any plans to propose binding legislation on public consultation.\n\n(1) https:\/\/rulemaking.worldbank.org\/en\/data\/explorecountries\/netherland\n(2) https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/kamerstukken\/2011\/06\/17\/kabinetsstandpunt-internetconsultatie-wetgeving\n(3) https:\/\/www.rtlnieuws.nl\/tech\/artikel\/5238742\/nctv-wetsvoorstel-privacy-onzorgvuldig-amnesty-kritiek","evidence":[{"title":"Evidence 1","link":"https:\/\/rulemaking.worldbank.org\/en\/data\/explorecountries\/netherland"},{"title":"Evidence 2","link":"https:\/\/www.rijksoverheid.nl\/documenten\/kamerstukken\/2011\/06\/17\/kabinetsstandpunt-internetconsultatie-wetgeving"},{"title":"Evidence 3","link":"https:\/\/www.rtlnieuws.nl\/tech\/artikel\/5238742\/nctv-wetsvoorstel-privacy-onzorgvuldig-amnesty-kritiek"}],"indicator_id":"G.PI.PUBCON","indicator_name":"Governance (PI): Public consultation data","indicator_name_medium":"Public consultation frameworks","indicator_name_short":"Public consultation frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"7","response_text":"They exist and are operational.","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"31","response_text":"Requirements to publish data are set out in non-binding policy or guidance.","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e1.INTENT","subquestion_id":"68","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the publication of notice of intent in advance of public consultation processes."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e1.PROPOSED","subquestion_id":"61","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the publication of proposed regulations."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e1.COMMENTS","subquestion_id":"67","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the timely publication of a full set of public comments generated through public consultation processes."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e1.RESPONSE","subquestion_id":"66","subquestion_text":"The framework requires reasoned responses to be published alongside comments."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e1.FINAL","subquestion_id":"65","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the publication of final regulations and justification."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e1.CHALLENGE","subquestion_id":"64","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the publication of challenges to laws and regulations that have undergone public consultation processes, as well as their results."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e3.TIMELY","subquestion_id":"17","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require that data is regularly updated."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."},{"response_id":"98","response_text":"They cover one or more localities and are a representative example of the kind of rules\/guidance that can be found for all, or most, localities.","varname":"G.PI.PUBCON.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"18","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive, in terms of jurisdiction, is the coverage of the laws, regulations, policies, or guidance assessed for this question?"}]},{"score":"0","justification":"To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a basis for collecting and publishing data on the performance of right to information (RTI) \/ freedom of information (FOI) processes?\n\nUnder the Wet openbaarheid van bestuur (Wob) (1), anyone can request administrative bodies to disclose documents.

Some use open data sets, some buy Trade Register data in bulk. DR3Data, Company.info, Graydon, Altares Dun & Bradstreet, Creditsafe and other KYC-companies and data brokers analyse this data and provide company profiles that combine (open) datasets on company information. They provide insight into the identity, suitability and risks of business relationships, to protect companies and help them grow through targeted sales and marketing.  A google search for KYC services in the Netherlands provides a long list of companies that offer these services and products. The above-mentioned companies are part of a branch organization called VVZBI: the Association for Corporate B2B Information. \n\nAlso, the Chamber of Commerce (KvK), an independant, commercial government body that manages the Trade Register, offers the KvK Dataservice for a monthly plus pay-per-use fee through which the software, databases and systems of companies can be connected to the Trade Register, so they always have 'the most recent information' at their disposal, 'straight from the source'. According to the KvK, this is the best way to stay in the loop about who they are doing business with. (1) Therefore, the KvK is trying to restrict the use of Company Register information by the companies mentioned above, for instance through the Terms of Use that apply to Trade Register information. (2)  However, currently there is a court case going on against the KVK for applying these Terms of Use. Database law and the Trade Register Act, provide the KVK with ownership and control over what happens with the data.  From internal documents acquired through an FOI-request, it appears that the KVK is taking a commercial approach. It tries to position themselves as a KYC stakeholder, limiting certain companies to provide similar services through the Terms of Use. So KYC and due diligence companies, through the VVZBI, have taken the KVK to court for excluding them from the KvK's dataservice, monopolising company data and its use. They claim the KvK cannot invoke the database rights, since the database was created as part of the KvK's fulfillment of its public task.(3) In Dutch media there is a lot of critique on the KvK's financial model and the way they are expanding their service. \n\nAccording to the KvK, by far most of the data from the Trade Register is used for public service: all governments, like municipalities, provinces and water boards use the data in the performance of their duties. (4) For instance when they grant permits or collect taxes. In 2015 the ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate has decided that by january 2021 at the latest, all governing bodies should be connected to the Trade Register and that they have to use it when, in the performance of their duties, they need information about a company or legal entity. This was laid down in article 30 of the Hrw 2007. (5) Also, governments use due diligence tools or services provided by private companies. Graydon for instance, works with national, provincial and regional governments in public-private partnerships, helping them solve problems through data insights. (6)\n\nCivil society also uses company information provided by the KvK, and in databases of private due diligence companies. Their reports and research into their members is based on the databases and information products these companies provide. For instance, SOMO, a critical, independent non-profit foundation that investigates multinationals and the impact of their activities on people and the environment, uses company profiles provided by the KvK, but also international financial data bases (like Thomson Reuters) and local ones. (7) Also, labor associations such as FNV use the services provided by the KvK and due diligence companies.  \n\nAlso, different private sectors make use of KYC-companies and the KvK Dataservice. For instance, Company.info works with ABN Amro (bank), GreenChoice (renewable energy), Athlon (car leasing), Talent Peaks (recruitment agency), Knab (online bank). (8) Altares Dun & Bradstreet's database is used by more than 100.000 organizations. (9) And Graydon, who works with companies in the financial sector, in construction, and in the 'flex-market'. (10) \n\nThe media uses company data as well, mostly directly from the KvK Trade Register and UBO-register.  Investigative journalism platforms, like  Follow the Money and The Correspondent, use it to expose shady public-private deals, misuse of public support measures, fraud, et cetera.  (11) (12) (13) Also, newspapers use company data. For example,  the NRC built a database to find out how many company directors are female.  (14) We do not know for sure whether media companies ever use private KYC-companies or data brokers. \n\nIt is impossible to determine the precise magnitude of the impact of company information use. The examples above show a positive impact: the media uses UBO and company data to expose shady deals and fraud, and all big companies and banks seem to need the services of KYC and due diligence to grow and protect their businesses. However, as all the question in this indicator have shown, company information in the Netherlands is still very much closed off. It is publicly available, but only through registration and payment, and almost none of it comes in machine-readable, reusable formats. That is why a lot of potential value is still lost. For example, small start up companies and independent journalists may not be able to access the data because they cannot afford to pay for it.

However, the data supplied by registries the Land Registry (Kadaster) and the Basic Registry Topography, do not seem to be utilised often by private sectors, civil society organisations and academics. Presumably because the problem of  housing shortages is mapped out through demographic statistics data, and because in the Netherlands there are not many problems relating to land use and for instance the environment. There is however some evidence of interesting research by the media, and the first one does concern a topic that could incite policy change: in August 2019 newspaper Trouw published an article about land use: 'Holland continues to urbanise at the expense of farmers'. They used figures on farm land and data analysis about land use from the independent government organisation Statistics Netherlands (CBS), too conclude that in twenty years, almost 60.000 extra acres of land have been deployed for living, working and infrastructure, but that also 9.000 acres have been given back to nature (between 2012 and 2015. (1) \n\nFurthermore, in September 2020 newspaper Trouw published an article: 'Almost no Dutch woman owns land. How strange is that?'. It was an interview with a professor from Oxford, Linda Scott, who researches womens' economic position. (2) And newspaper The Volkskrant published an article in November 2020, called 'Who owns the land in the Netherlands?'. They wrote: 'Space for houses, recreation, windmills or food cultivation is becoming scarcer. So the question arises who owns the land in the Netherlands and who can determine what happens to that land.' At the request of the Volkskrant, the Land Registry had compiled a list of the three hundred largest landowners in the Netherlands, how much land they own and which part of it they use. The paper discovered that the State and other government bodies together own two thirds of the total land of these 300 owners. (3) \n\nThere is also some evidence from land data being used by researchers. For example, the researcher Linda Scott mentioned above, researched the amount of Dutch women that own land, to conclude there is severe inequality due to a 'shocking male monopoly of money and power', while land is the most important source of human wealth. Also, the Trouw article mentioned above about urbanisation at the expense of farmland, is based on data analysis by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and mentions research from Wageningen University, in which predictive calculation were made about how much farmland will be lost in The Flevopolder between 2025 and 2040. In the research report, the future land use in the province of Flevoland is outlined based on: the current land use situation; current and expected developments which influence the size and use of the current agricultural area, and opportunities and obstacles in land use for the sub areas where these developments (may) take place. Also, it provides advice on the strategy to be followed in dealing with the developments mentioned and concludes with recommendations. (4) Also, there is some evidence suggesting that this research report may lead to policy change. It was presented to State Secretary Knops of the Ministry of Interior and Kingdom Relations, who said he supported the initiative to try out new combinations of land use. Knops is prepared to make government land available for this purpose. This in line with his policy of using government land for innovative and multiple land use and thus for social benefit. (5) \n\nFurthermore, there is The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, which researched global land use, for instance in the context of sustainability. They contribute to reports at global an European level. (6) There is no evidence of other recent research focussed on the Netherlands. Lastly, the Cadastre has a 'datalabs': an initiative that consists of linked data 'stories', in which they combine the data from different registries that they manage (like land use and tenure), with other datasets, in order to show the potential value of their. An example: they linked the statistics on the amount of occupied ICU beds, which the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) offers as part of their CoronaWatchNL-project, to the land use data from the Basis Registry Topography, which includes building types, to find out where the closest vacant hotel building is in the vicinity of each hospital. This could solve capacity problems when these hospitals fill up. The vacancy status of these building is obtained by linking the land use data to data from the Basic Registration Addresses and buildings, which contains the status of each building. (7) The Kadaster is just experimenting with this project (and others) to show potential value, so they are trying to affect policy change with them. \n\n(1) Van Velzen, 'Nederland verstedelijkt en dat gaat ten koste van de boeren', Trouw, 27 augustus, https:\/\/www.trouw.nl\/nieuws\/nederland-verstedelijkt-verder-en-dat-gaat-ten-koste-van-de-boeren~b6e018e7\/. \n(2) Nauta, 'Bijna geen enkele Nederlandse vrouw bezit land, hoe raar is dat?', Trouw, 12 september 2020, https:\/\/www.trouw.nl\/economie\/bijna-geen-enkele-nederlandse-vrouw-bezit-land-hoe-raar-is-dat~b78823e8\/. \n(3) Van Dinther, 'Van wie is de grond in Nederland?', De Volkskrant, 20 november 2020,  https:\/\/www.volkskrant.nl\/nieuws-achtergrond\/van-wie-is-de-grond-in-nederland~b5ac8934\/.  \n(4) Vogelzang, Smit, Kuiper, Paul & Gillet, '\u200b\u200bGrond in beweging : ontwikkelingen in het grondgebruik in de provincie Flevoland in de periode tot 2025 en 2040', Wageningen University and Research, 2019 (file attached).\n(5) Rijksvastgoedbedrijf, 'Staatssecretaris Knops bij ontvangst rapport 'Grond in Beweging': innovatief grondgebruik steunen', 8 maart 2019, https:\/\/www.rijksvastgoedbedrijf.nl\/actueel\/nieuws\/2019\/03\/08\/staatssecretaris-knops-bij-ontvangst-rapport-%E2%80%98grond-in-beweging%E2%80%99-innovatief-grondgebruik-steunen. \n(6) Bringezu et al., 'Assessing gland use: balancing consumption with global supply', UN Environment Programme (file attached). \n(7) Kadaster Labs, 'COVID-19 statistieken voor Nederland', https:\/\/labs.kadaster.nl\/stories\/covid-19\/.
