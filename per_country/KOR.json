This center has roles that develop and manage greenhouse gas information and statistics, analyze and verify related statistics, and publishes them annually. For each of the five sectors: energy, industrial process, agriculture, LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry), and waste, the relevant governing body calculates emissions according to the 1996 IPCC guidelines. And the Greenhouse Gas Information Center collects and verifies the data. The collected and verified greenhouse gas information is released to the Public Data Portal by year, field, and gas and can be downloaded(3).

In particular, policy support statistics include statistics that support procurement policies that are closely related to national policies, such as SMEs, social enterprises, and green products. The provision of this statistical data made convenient use possible for both the ministries in charge of the policy and the organizations that need to submit related statistics to those ministries(1)(2)(3).\nThe Public Procurement Service announced the \"Three-Year Plan for Public Procurement Statistics and Data Development\" in April 2021 in order to increase the reliability of public procurement statistics and data and maximize their utilization. This plan includes securing the diversity and timeliness of data, enhancing the convenience and accuracy of use, enhancing the reliability and utilization of data, improving the procurement data management system, and enhancing professionalism(4). With the implementation of this plan, it is expected that the open scope and usability of procurement data will increase.\n\nSources \n\n(1) Public Procurement Statistical System,
