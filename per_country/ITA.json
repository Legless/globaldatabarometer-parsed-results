Notwithstanding the information required by the law are there, they differ substantially in content and in format since the law (2) do not specify which specific information should be made public and the open data format is not a requirement. As a consequence, there is the case of parties which publish a lot of identifying information for individual donors (3), while others just publish name and last name (4) so preventing the possibility to effectively identify the donor. The situation regarding the role of third parties is more complicated since it is very difficult to identify the associations, foundations and committees required by law to comply with the transparency obligations and in this way also the Commission (5) in charge of monitoring and verification is undermined in its work. \n\nSOURCES\n(1)\tItalian Parliament, Erogazione ai partiti politici iscritti nel registro nazionale, 2021,  https:\/\/parlamento18.camera.it\/199 \n(2)\tLaw n 3 Misure per il contrasto dei reati contro la pubblica amministrazione, nonche' in materia di prescrizione del reato e in materia di trasparenza dei partiti e movimenti politici, 2019, https:\/\/www.normattiva.it\/uri-res\/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2019-01-09;3\n(3)\tFratelli d'Italia, 2021, Political donations, https:\/\/www.fratelli-italia.it\/contributi\/\n(4)\tMovimento 5 Stelle, 2021, Political donations, https:\/\/rousseau.movimento5stelle.it\/transparency\n(5)\tCommissione di garanzia degli statuti e per la trasparenza e il controllo dei rendiconti dei partiti politici, 2020, Annual report of the commission on transparency of political parties, http:\/\/www.senato.it\/application\/xmanager\/projects\/leg18\/file\/relazione_28_aprile_2020.pdf\n\nFull list\nCommission for the guarantee of statutes and transparency and monitoring of the financial statement of political parties, 2020, Annual report of the commission on transparency of political parties, http:\/\/www.senato.it\/application\/xmanager\/projects\/leg18\/file\/relazione_28_aprile_2020.pdf\nLaw n 13 Erogazione ai partiti politici iscritti nel registro nazionale, 2014, https:\/\/parlamento18.camera.it\/199 \n10 volte meglio, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, https:\/\/diecivoltemeglio.com\nAlternativa popolare, Transparency L. 3\/2019, 2021, https:\/\/www.alternativapopolare.it\/trasparenza-rendiconto-esercizio-finanziario-anno-2017-precedenti\/\nArticolo 1, Contributions Law 3\/2019, https:\/\/articolo1mdp.it\/trasparenza\/\nCambiamo, Donors register, 2021, https:\/\/cambiamo.eu\/registro-erogatori\/\nIl centro democratico, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, http:\/\/www.ilcentrodemocratico.it\nForza Italia, Transparency L. 3\/2019, 2021, http:\/\/www.forzaitalia.it\/notizie\/11846\/Trasparenza_legge_comma_11\nFratelli d'Italia, Contributions law 3\/2019, 2021, https:\/\/www.fratelli-italia.it\/contributi\/\nItalia Viva, Transparency, 2021, https:\/\/www.italiaviva.it\/trasparenza\nLega Nord, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, https:\/\/www.leganord.org\/component\/phocadownload\/category\/287-contributi-l-3-2019\nLega per Salvini Premier, Transparency, 2021, https:\/\/www.legapersalvinipremier.it\/t_trasparenza.asp?l1=192\nLiberi e Uguali, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, http:\/\/liberieuguali.it\/\nMovimento 5 Stelle, donations, 2021, https:\/\/rousseau.movimento5stelle.it\/transparency\nMaie, Financial declarations, 2021, https:\/\/maiemondiale.com\/trasparenza\/\nPatt, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, https:\/\/patt.tn.it\/contribuzioni-2020\/\nPartito Democratico, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, https:\/\/www.partitodemocratico.it\/partito\/versamenti-2019\/\nPartito Socialista, Contributions, 2021, http:\/\/www.partitosocialista.it\/erogazioni-liberali-e-benefici-fiscali-da-erogazioni-liberali\/\n+Europa, Transparency, 2021, https:\/\/piueuropa.eu\/trasparenza\/\nSinistra Italiana, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, http:\/\/www.sinistraitaliana.si\/registro-contributi-liberali-si\/\nSVP, Transparency, 2021, https:\/\/www.svp.eu\/de\/transparenz-919.html\nUnion Valdotaine, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, http:\/\/www.unionvaldotaine.org\/datapage.asp?id=1565&l=1\nUSEI, Programme USEI, 2021, https:\/\/www.usei-it.org\nRadicali, Contributions L. 3\/2019, 2021, https:\/\/radicali.it\/contributi-ricevuti-legge-3-2019\/ \nAzione, Azione, 2021, https:\/\/www.azione.it\/  \nSiamo Europei, Contributions, 2021, https:\/\/www.siamoeuropei.it\/\nSinistra Ecologia e Libert\u00e0, Finance, 2021, http:\/\/www.sinistraecologialiberta.it\/partito\/tesoreria\/","evidence":[{"title":"Annual report of the commission on transparency of political parties -

However, the law did not provide for any information about the publication of information on the performance of public administrations in this regard. Non-binding documents was adopted in this direction by the National Anticorruption Authority in 2016 (2) and by the Minister of Public Administration in 2017 (3) and 2019 (4). The framework does not explicitly require the publication of the number of FOIA requests, but the list of requests received and processed. The number can be deduced consequently. Moreover, the framework does not require the indication of the agency\/department to which the request is referred to. However, since each public administration (national or local) is required to publish the info on the requests it has received, this information is in general automatically available. For bigger institutions structured in several departments, there is no obligation to publish the information on the relevant department. \n\nSOURCES\n(1)\tLaw decree n. 97, Revisione e semplificazione
