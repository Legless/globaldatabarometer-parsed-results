In addition, the general structure of the portal is user-friendly.\nTimeliness\nAccording to the law on Public procurement, all tender announcements and results of tenders should be in the portal. That is why all information in the portal is up to date. For example, the last agreement on the portal is the agreement signed today (22 July 2021). Or the last cancellation date of tender is yesterday.\nThe portal was launched per the presidential decree (6) (16\/04\/2019     \u2116 647). The historical data at the portal is from 2018, the old tender information has not been migrated to the portal.

Although it was slow, there were few datasets published. Starting from 2014, there were several events and competitions were organized for increasing data utilization (2). \nHowever, all initiatives are episodic and do not have solid regulatory support. A recent National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government 2020-2022 highlights a task for all government agencies to develop an open data section on their website. Furthermore, the National Action plan targets to adopt open data standards by 2022. So far, there is no progress in the implementation. The National Open Data Portal maintained by the Ministry of Transport, Communication and High Tech publishes several open data. Conceptually, the portal covers API services, documentation, code samples, etc. However, in practice, all the published data (or API services) are imitative and lack useful data sources. Many of the published open data have not been updated. Almost 80% of datasets were published on either 18 December 2020 or 6 October 2017. Datasets are not important, but mostly informative such as basic location information of mountains, rivers, forests, national parks, seed sellers, customs calculator, postal service fees and etc. \n\nFew hackathons were organized by public organizations, nevertheless, they have not targeted the usage of open data. The portal also lists several applications built by using open data such as exchange rates, switching SIM cards, locations of post offices, etc. Again, those cannot be considered a promotion of the open data concept.\n\nOther than the national open data portal, The Ministry of Agriculture developed a data portal and publishes open data related to agriculture. The portal has a data visualization opening that presents general statistical information (3). This portal publishes several interesting agriculture-related data and provides basic data analysis capabilities. \n\nSummary:\nThe \"National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government for 2020-2022\" was adopted. One of the main goals of the plan is to increase transparency and make an important contribution to ensuring access to information. Building a better open data ecosystem with data standards is also covered in the action plan. We can expect that open data initiatives will be enhanced in the coming years. So far, the Open data field is in the early stages of its development.\n\nSources\nLinks accessed on 1 - 20 July 2021\n\n(1) https:\/\/mincom.gov.az\/az\/view\/news\/449\/achiq-melumatlar-portalinin-unvani-deyishdi\n(2) https:\/\/www.e-gov.az\/az\/news\/read\/620\n(3) https:\/\/agrodata.az\/az\/","evidence":[],"indicator_id":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT","indicator_name":"Capability (C): Open data initiative","indicator_name_medium":"Open data initiative","indicator_name_short":"Open data initiative","responses":[{"response_id":"62","response_text":"There has been a government-led open government data initiative, but there is limited evidence of recent activity.","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"178","subquestion_text":"Has there been any form of government-led open government data initiative during the study period?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.TEAM","subquestion_id":"177","subquestion_text":"There is a government team in place supporting open data activities."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.BUDGET","subquestion_id":"176","subquestion_text":"There is an allocated budget for open data activities."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.PORTAL","subquestion_id":"174","subquestion_text":"There is a well-maintained open data portal."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.GUIDANCE","subquestion_id":"167","subquestion_text":"There is guidance and support for government publication of open data."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.e.e1.LEADERSHIP","subquestion_id":"173","subquestion_text":"Senior political leaders back the open data initiative."},{"response_id":"43","response_text":"The open data initiatives covers much of both national and sub-national government.","varname":"C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"172","subquestion_text":"How widely does this, or similar, open data initiatives apply?"}]},{"score":"0","justification":"Municipalities and local government organizations have little capacity to build open data initiatives stand alone.

However, there are several regulatory documents that discuss the accessibility of information for disabled citizens. \nAlthough the country has joined the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, there is no practice of using special means, tools and software to ensure access to information for citizens with disabilities. Based on the requirements of the Convention, a decision was made to facilitate the use of state information resources by citizens with disabilities. That is why, a Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (No. 189 of September 4, 2012) was adopted. According to the resolution on Requirements for the creation and management of Internet information resources of government agencies, there are several requirements for maintaining the access of disabled citizens to public information. In order for people with disabilities to effectively access and use information resources, access to Internet information resources must be provided in accordance with the international standard WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guideline) 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guide).\n-\ttext alternatives for non-textual content, transcripts for audio and video content, subtitles, use of large fonts, font selection, colour management, character spacing should be provided;\n-\tthe creation of a time management function, providing users with sufficient time to read and use the content, the ability to control processes from the keyboard, the function of deactivating animated images, the content must be clear and consistent;\n-\treadable and understandable language (style) should be used;(part 11)(2)\nIt should be noted that in accordance with the requirements of Part 8 of the Rules, each state body is responsible for the fulfilment of the responsibilities. (2)\nConclusion\nThe above rules apply to all government agencies. It should be noted that this requirement for people with disabilities is set in the rules of the Cabinet of Ministers from 2020, so the required software or add-ins to the official websites of government agencies have not been implemented yet.

The law discusses \"information\" disclosure, there is no obligation for the parties to open information as open data. All published information is in PDF format (scanned image).\nAnnual financial reports of political parties are posted on the official website of the Central Election Commission of the Republic of Azerbaijan (2) (Article 21.6) (03.06. 1992 \u2116 147).\nAccording to the Law on political parties, the maximum amount of donations a person can make to one or more parties during the year may not exceed ten thousand manats (Article 19.7).\n\nIn conclusion, the regulations and legal framework give a sufficient overview of political party accountability in terms of financial activities. Nevertheless, in practice, such accountability is formal and does not cover the details of financial resource usage. We can see it from the published reports. For example, the leading party, The New Azerbaijan Party, published one page PDF financial report (4). The Party presents the costs with general statements like \"funds spent on current works\".
