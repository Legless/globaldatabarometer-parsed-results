All state budget's data share common identifiers following the \nOrdinance on budget classifications. (5) The Ordinance defines administrative, economic, functional, and program classifications.

The common identifier for budget data is the so-called '\u0160ifra,' the label in the first column in the budget tables.\nData for the sub-national government and the data on the state-owned

Besides, data are in numerous datasets.
