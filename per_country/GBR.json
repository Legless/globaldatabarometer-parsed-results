The JNCC provides a spreadsheet that contains a variety of conservation designation listings - including red lists - for some 13,000 UK  \"taxa\"[7] but it is not user-friendly. There is no UK red list for every species group, for example, reptiles although there are European ones.[8] \n\nThe UK has legal protections through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981,[9] and its schedules contain the lists of protected species[10] and those that can be sold or killed, which are reviewed every 5 years.[11]  Conservation groups working on reptiles and amphibians have complained that relying on red listing for protection is too narrow as it only reaches species at imminent risk of extinction while many are still in danger but could lose protections in the reviews.[12] They also complain that UK legal protections lists focus on intentional killing and less on slower extinction through land use changes.\n\nThere are many pieces of EU law requiring species monitoring and reporting but their status is unclear after Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Joint Nature Conservation Committee, 2021. https:\/\/jncc.gov.uk\/\n[2] Fifth National Report to the United Nations Convention on

However, they also found some issues that remained through the period of the barometer survey. The main problem is that the data is not validated and verified, purely relying on self-reporting, so it is possible to put fake names or addresses. There is no need to present any form of ID. Global Witness also criticised that despite the availability of the register, the government was not using it to proactively identify suspicious entities, particularly new types of company that are less regulated. The public register includes name, month and year of birth but no linking identifier that enables connecting companies to the same person.[2]\n\nThe Government agreed in 2020 to introduce compulsory identity verification for all directors, PSCs and people filling in information. Third parties can be tasked with the verification, including registration companies and secretarial services. There are also other proposed changes to require additional information from companies that claim exemption from the PSC register.[3]\n\n\n\n[1] The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment)\nRegulations, 2019. https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/860279\/Money_Laundering_and_Terrorist_Financing__Amendment__Regulations_2019.pdf\n[2] THE COMPANIES WE KEEP\nWhat the UK's open data register actually tells us about company ownership, 2018. https:\/\/www.globalwitness.org\/en\/campaigns\/corruption-and-money-laundering\/anonymous-company-owners\/companies-we-keep\/#chapter-4\/section-1\n[3] Corporate Transparency\nand Register Reform, Government response to the consultation on options to enhance the role of Companies House and increase the transparency of UK corporate entities, 2020. https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/925059\/corporate-transparency-register-reform-government-response.pdf","evidence":[{"title":"Bulk download beneficial ownership","link":"http:\/\/download.companieshouse.gov.uk\/en_pscdata.html"},{"title":"API access","link":"https:\/\/developer-specs.company-information.service.gov.uk\/streaming-api\/guides\/overview"},{"title":"Global Witness UK report","link":"https:\/\/www.globalwitness.org\/en\/campaigns\/corruption-and-money-laundering\/anonymous-company-owners\/companies-we-keep\/#chapter-4\/section-1"},{"title":"Government reform plans","link":"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/925059\/corporate-transparency-register-reform-government-response.pdf"},{"title":"UK Open Government Licence","link":"https:\/\/www.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/doc\/open-government-licence\/version\/3\/"}],"indicator_id":"A.COMPANY.BOT","indicator_name":"Availability (CI): Beneficial ownership","indicator_name_medium":"Beneficial ownership data","indicator_name_short":"Beneficial ownership","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.ORGID","subquestion_id":"28","subquestion_text":"The dataset contains unique identifiers for each company."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.OWNERID","subquestion_id":"277","subquestion_text":"The dataset contains identifying information for each beneficial owner."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.INTERESTS","subquestion_id":"278","subquestion_text":"The dataset contains details of the interests held by each beneficial owner."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.GENDER","subquestion_id":"23","subquestion_text":"Data includes information about individuals' sex and\/or gender."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e1.STANDARDS","subquestion_id":"22","subquestion_text":"The data is published according to one or more relevant data standards."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.COMPANY.BOT.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

The UK Geospatial Strategy[8] acknowledges the lack of quality data and tasks the Geospatial Commission to identify a targeted approach to support delivery of a national land use framework.[9]\u00a0\n\n\n[1] Rural\/urban classifications, 2011. https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/methodology\/geography\/geographicalproducts\/ruralurbanclassifications\n[2] Live tables on land use, 2020. https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistical-data-sets\/live-tables-on-land-use\n[3] UKLand - National Land Use Database, 2021. https:\/\/www.geomni.co.uk\/ukland\n[4] A Land Cover Atlas of the United Kingdom, 2017. https:\/\/figshare.com\/articles\/journal_contribution\/A_Land_Cover_Atlas_of_the_United_Kingdom_Document_\/5266495\n[5] Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Land Cover Map data, 2017. https:\/\/digimap.edina.ac.uk\/webhelp\/environment\/data_information\/landcover_data.htm\n[6] Forestry Commission Open Data, 2021. https:\/\/data-forestry.opendata.arcgis.com\/search?tags=GB\n[7] Natural England Regional Agricultural Land Classification Maps, 2021. http:\/\/publications.naturalengland.org.uk\/category\/5954148537204736\n[8] Unlocking the power of location:The UK's geospatial strategy, 2020. https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/unlocking-the-power-of-locationthe-uks-geospatial-strategy\n[9] Finding Common Ground: The urgent need for better land use data, 2021. https:\/\/geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk\/2021\/01\/21\/finding-common-ground-the-urgent-need-for-better-land-use-data\/","evidence":[{"title":"Tables on land use","link":"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistical-data-sets\/live-tables-on-land-use"},{"title":"Corine Land Cover Atlas","link":"https:\/\/figshare.com\/articles\/journal_contribution\/A_Land_Cover_Atlas_of_the_United_Kingdom_Document_\/5266495"},{"title":"Forestry Commisison GIS","link":"https:\/\/data-forestry.opendata.arcgis.com\/search?tags=GB"},{"title":"Magic mapping tool","link":"https:\/\/magic.defra.gov.uk\/"},{"title":"Geospatial Commission plans on land use data","link":"https:\/\/geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk\/2021\/01\/21\/finding-common-ground-the-urgent-need-for-better-land-use-data\/"}],"indicator_id":"A.LAND.ELU","indicator_name":"Availability (L): Existing land use","indicator_name_medium":"Land use data","indicator_name_short":"Land use","responses":[{"response_id":"19","response_text":"Data is available, but not as a result of government action.","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e1.DICTIONARY","subquestion_id":"301","subquestion_text":"Each record is categorized according to a standardized land use dictionary."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e1.FOREST","subquestion_id":"302","subquestion_text":"Forested areas can be identified in available data or in a related dataset."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e1.PROTECTEDAREAS","subquestion_id":"288","subquestion_text":"Protected areas can be identified in available data or in a related dataset."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e1.GEO","subquestion_id":"271","subquestion_text":"Each record includes a geospatial reference."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e1.SOURCES","subquestion_id":"270","subquestion_text":"Metadata provides information about the source(s) from which the data was built."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.ELU.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

Public procurement data is available online on two main platforms, Contracts Finder[1] and Find a Tender[2] for high value tenders, plus in a variety of local and regional sites. Unfortunately, the tenders available on the central sites miss some 70% of public sector requests.[3] When data is available it is open, machine readable and conforming to Open Procurement Data Standard.[4]\n\nWhile data on tenders can be found, even if through huge technical efforts to make it comprehensive, there is no data on awarded contracts available to the public, only suppliers registered with the systems. There are third party tools that scrape Contracts Finder and other sites to present this information but it is not known how patchy it may be.[5] \n\nThe situation is worse for tracking the delivery of contracts, where there is more limited information. At the time of the 2018 collapse of strategic supplier Carillion the government had spent months trying to get a complete picture and were still unable to get all data for local contracts.[6] \n\nThe COVID crisis has created an unprecedented crisis of confidence on public procurement. In the months up to July 2020 new contracts worth \u00a317.3 billion were awarded to suppliers,  \u00a310.5 billion without any competition.[7] Transparency International has raised possible corruption concerns in contracts worth \u00a33.7 billion.[8]\n\nA complete planned overhaul of UK public procurement after Brexit was outlined in a green paper at the end of 2020.[9] This will make it compulsory for all contracting bodies to use the Open Contracting Data Standard to enable analysis by public bodies. There are also proposals to increase the publication of contracts, and awards, including changes made to pre-existing contracts.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Contracts Finder, 2021.
