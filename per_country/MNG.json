The data between 1990 and 2015 contain detailed information on sources of greenhouse gas emissions by disaggregating GHG emissions and removals by sector. A total of six sectors (including energy, agriculture, industry, land use, waste, and international flights) were used to estimate their GHG emissions and removals by using GHG-related 14 indicators and reporting them to the National Statistics Office. Although there are some open data that includes key elements, available data is outdated and limited in terms of contents, indicators, and disaggregation. The GHG-related 14 indicators have not been estimated since 2014(1). As stated in Mongolia's National Inventory Report, there is an emerging need to estimate GHG emissions. To collect data, the NSO or relevant ministries need to collect the data and prepare the estimates by applying the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2). Except for Mongolia's National Inventory Report, there is a lack of publicly available reports and publications. Also, relevant stakeholders and procedures to obtain the data are unclear. \n\n\nSources: \n(1). http:\/\/1212.mn\/tables.aspx?TBL_ID=DT_NSO_2400_015V3\n(2).

Instead, two national policies including the State Policy on Open Data 2019 (1)and the National 'E-governance' program 2019-2021 (2) are enacted to regulate open data. The National E-governance program (2019-2021). Over the last few years, several stakeholders including the Communications and Information Technology Authority, National Statistics Office of Mongolia, and the General Authority for State Registration of Mongolia have been promoting the 'open data. In addition to that, the Cabinet Secretariat of the Government of Mongolia has been implementing the project, 'Smart Governance', in cooperation with World Bank(3). One of the main activities was creating the open-data portal. As a result, the government's open data portal(4) is created in 2020. The portal includes relevant sections that guide users including the definition of terms, licensing, and data formats. The aforementioned policies lack such regulations and detailed requirements as stated in the Open Data Readiness Assessment Report (5). \nIn 2021, the Permanent Committee on the Innovation and E-governance and Permanent Committee on Public discussion on the 'Draft Law on Public Data' and the 'Draft Law on Protection of Personal Data, submitted by members of Parliament was held on 17 August 2021.
