However, those datasets only contains data reported by lobbyists, not public officials (in compliance with the law), and data is only updated annually. \n\nIn practice, the quality of the declarations varies significantly from one lobbyist to another. In most cases, the declarations only provide very broad information, difficult to analyze automatically without significant human qualitative extra work. There are also significant loopholes in the legislation, allowing some lobbyists to under-report their activities while still being compliant with the regulatory framework. In summary, data quality is excellent but data relevance is poorer: there are so many loopholes that data do not show a faithful image of the reality of lobbying. This view is shared by civil society (2), the GRECO (3) and most press coverage (4).

A platform to help visualizing data on political parties is available (3).\n\nHowever, in practice, significant limits are observed.\nFirst, data available often consists of relatively aggregated data, with not enough details. For campaign finance, supporting documents are not available as open data ; citizens need to make an appointment and go physically to the CNCCFP headquarters to get access to them (4) ; this right to information was obtained following a procedure filled by journalists against the CNCCFP in 2015 (5). Some data are available in PDF in the CNCCFP's annual reports but not published as open data simultaneously (6). \nFor political parties, financial accounts must be reported in a standardized template ; for each financial category, some breakdown is available, although remaining very broad in many cases. For instance, for assets and liabilities, a balance sheet is provided but it does not contain data such as the list of real estate properties owned by the party ; significant amounts (sometimes exceeding 1MEUR) are often reported in vague and miscellaneous categories such as \"other debts\" or \"other fixed assets\". Details on political parties' spendings are reported and published with some breakdown by broad categories, but details is unavailable (even on site upon appointment) (4, ibid).\n\nSecond, datasets are usually published after long delays. The data related to the last European elections (2019) and municipal elections (2020) were not yet published when those lines are written (July 2021), despite the existence of articles in the news commenting the CNCCFP's decisions (7) ; the data contained in those articles could only be obtained by the journalists on site at the CNCCFP headquarters (4, ibid).\n\nDetails on donors are unavailable, be it for parties or campaigns, despite the fact that parties and candidates must transfer the list of their donors to the CNCCFP so that donations ceilings can be controlled. Journalists, when they make an appointment to the CNCCFP, only get access to anonymized data (8). When they get access to the data, it is usually via leaks, not open data (9).\n\nPolitical parties : there is a section for in kind and non-financial support in the political parties datasets (\"concours en nature\" tab). In practice, this section is usually poorly reported by parties and candidates. Several upfront national political parties do not declare any in-kind and non-financial support.\n\nData on in-kind donations are poorly available, which is probably a consequence of the strong regulation on corporate donations (in-kind donations are prohibited, and therefore in-kind donations mostly consist of volunteering time by members, hard to trace to aggregate). There is a section dedicated to it in the political parties reporting template, but it is not or very poorly reported. For campaign finance, details are unavailable as open data, but some information can be obtained on site upon appointment (such as an equivalence in mileage costs of cars put at disposition for free by members or campaigners).\n\nFinally, more than 20% of existing political parties are not compliant with their reporting requirements (10).\n\n(1) Electoral code as modified by Law n\u00b02017-1339 (2017).

Policy recommendations include modifying the data to allow cross analysis, notably by using common identifiers for companies in the asset declarations, lobbying register and national company register.\n\nInteroperability has been identified as a challenge to open data as a tool for public integrity since 2016. When France was hosting the Open Government Partnership Summit, a report was published by the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life on open data for public integrity, pointing out the need for more interoperability (2). No report was published specifically on open data for public integrity since then, but broader reports have recently deplored a persistant lack of interoperability notably for company registers (3) and interoperability was a key issue in the last OGP national action plan in France (4).\n\n(1) Transparency International. \"Integrity Watch report\".

Notwithstanding, the CNIL, the French independent administrative authority (DPA) that controls data processing and freedoms, and the privacy of data, gives a full definition of \"Open Data\" (5).\nThe French framework has legal restrictions on open licensing (6). Those restrictions limit the use of open data that contain personal and private information, defined in the French law n\u00b0 78-17, relating to computers, files and freedoms, January 6, 1978 (7). Thus, the re-user must complete all necessary formalities with the CNIL.\nNo specific standards are required for publishing open data, the law n\u00b0 2016-1321 for a Digital Republic, October 7, 2016, mentions in the article L.300-4 that any provision made in electronic form in application of this law is made in an open standard, easily reusable and exploitable by an automated processing system. \nThere is no training or capacity building among government officials, however the government launched a public-private initiative for open data within governmental agencies. Selected entrepreneurs for public good work with governmental officials to expand the publishing and the re-using (8).\nThe law applies to all French localities, government agencies and public administration, but the implementation is very slow (9)(10). In a summary published on March 11, 2019, the Court of Auditors recommends \"more effective management of the opening of data\" by the State (11). \nOn April 27, 2021, the Prime Minister requested the appointment of data administrators in several ministries or pioneer administrations to accelerate the movement (12). \n\n--\n\nSOURCES:\n(1) Law n\u00b0 2016-1321 for a Digital Republic, October 7, 2016, (Loi Lemaire): https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/dossierlegislatif\/JORFDOLE000031589829\/\n(2) Open data public platform: https:\/\/www.data.gouv.fr\/fr\/\n(3) Decree n\u00b0 2019-1088, October 25, 2019 to appoint French Digital Officer: https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/id\/JORFTEXT000039281619\/\n(4) ETALAB: https:\/\/www.etalab.gouv.fr\/qui-sommes-nous\n(5) Open Data definition by CNIL: https:\/\/www.cnil.fr\/fr\/open-data-la-protection-des-donnees-comme-vecteur-de-confiance\n(6) Open licensing restriction: https:\/\/www.etalab.gouv.fr\/licence-ouverte-open-licence-2017\n(7) Law n\u00b0 78-17, relating to computers, files and freedoms, January 6, 1978: https:\/\/www.cnil.fr\/fr\/la-loi-informatique-et-libertes\n(8) Entrepreneurs for public good work: https:\/\/entrepreneur-interet-general.etalab.gouv.fr\/\n(9) Open data observatory: https:\/\/www.observatoire-opendata.fr\/lobservatoire\/\n(10) Open data observatory report: https:\/\/www.observatoire-opendata.fr\/resultats\/\n(11) Court of Auditors report: https:\/\/www.vie-publique.fr\/publications-de-la-cour-des-comptes\n(12) National Data Administrators: https:\/\/www.data.gouv.fr\/fr\/datasets\/liste-des-administrateurs-ministeriels-des-donnees\/","evidence":[{"title":"French law n\u00b0 2016-1321 October 7th, 2016 for a Digital Republic","link":"https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/dossierlegislatif\/JORFDOLE000031589829\/"},{"title":"Definition of Open Data by French DPA - CNIL","link":"https:\/\/www.cnil.fr\/fr\/open-data-la-protection-des-donnees-comme-vecteur-de-confiance"},{"title":"Legal restriction of Open License","link":"https:\/\/www.etalab.gouv.fr\/licence-ouverte-open-licence-2017"},{"title":"the French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to computers, files and freedoms","link":"https:\/\/www.cnil.fr\/fr\/la-loi-informatique-et-libertes"},{"title":"French public-private initiative for open data","link":"https:\/\/entrepreneur-interet-general.etalab.gouv.fr\/"}],"indicator_id":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY","indicator_name":"Governance (G): Open data policy","indicator_name_medium":"Open data policy","indicator_name_short":"Open data policy","responses":[{"response_id":"10","response_text":"A framework exists and has the force of law.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.a.EXISTS","subquestion_id":"19","subquestion_text":"What is the nature of the framework?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.OPENDATA-DEF","subquestion_id":"207","subquestion_text":"The framework establishes a common definition of open data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.OPENLICENCES","subquestion_id":"206","subquestion_text":"The framework promotes open licensing without any restrictions beyond attribution and share-alike."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.MACHINE_READABLE","subquestion_id":"205","subquestion_text":"The framework requires to publish data in machine readable formats."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e1.STANDARDS","subquestion_id":"204","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance requires the use of specific data standards."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.e.e2.CAPACITY","subquestion_id":"203","subquestion_text":"The framework promotes training and capacity building among government officials."},{"response_id":"28","response_text":"The relevant laws, policies and guidance assessed cover the majority of localities and government agencies.","varname":"G.GOVERNANCE.ODPOLICY.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"217","subquestion_text":"How widely do these laws, regulations, policies or guidance apply?"}]},{"score":"100","justification":"The article 14 of the law n\u00b0 2016-1321 for a Digital Republic, October 7, 2016 is the main legal framework that established a public service of the data, hence the collection and publication of data, such as public finance (1).

Lobbying at local level is not yet covered (the reform is drafted but has been delayed several times). \n\nThe High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (HATVP) is in charge of collecting, controlling and publishing the data. The HATVP publishes binding guidelines that complement the law and goes into more details (3). In addition to this main register, there is a sector-specific framework applicable to the tobacco industry that remains active (4).\n\nThis lobbying register is covered by the \"open data by default\" principle, and data must be published as open data as explicitly recalled in the law (5).\n\nThe data are published as they are declared by lobbyists, without any verification process prior to publication. The HATVP can proceed to post-publication controls, although this is done with only limited means and legal obstacles. The details of the verification actions undertaken by the HATVP are detailed in its annual reports (5).\n\nData are not declared activity by activity, and the exact public decision targeted does not have to be declared. Therefore, the datasets are very well structured, but it is impossible to extract automatically all lobbying activities related to one given public decision. In addition, data are aggregated (one \"lobbying activity\" can agglomerate several \"lobbying actions\"), which makes it difficult to compare data. Consequently, this lobbying register is a poor tool to trace legislative footprint and it is therefore heavily criticized by civil society (6) and international organisations such as the Council of Europe (7).\n\n(1) Law n\u00b02013-907 on transparency of public life as modified by law n\u00b02016-1691 of Dec 9 2016.

Moreover, the existing register for lobbyists should cover all lobbyists having been in contact with PTEFs \u2013 at present, only those who have actively sought to contact PHFEs are required to register, therefore giving only a partial view of the situation.\"","evidence":[{"title":"Annex to the decree - list of lobbying activities","link":"https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/article_lc\/LEGIARTI000034792690"},{"title":"Annex to the decree - list of public officials targeted","link":"https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/article_lc\/LEGIARTI000041694518"},{"title":"HATVP guidelines","link":"https:\/\/www.hatvp.fr\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Lignes-directrices-octobre-2018.pdf"},{"title":"Law of October 11 2013","link":"https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/article_lc\/LEGIARTI000037313604"},{"title":"GRECO report","link":"https:\/\/rm.coe.int\/fifth-evaluation-round-preventing-corruption-and-promoting-integrity-i\/16809969fc"}],"indicator_id":"G.PI.LOBBY","indicator_name":"Governance (PI): Lobbying register","indicator_name_medium":"Lobbying frameworks","indicator_name_short":"Lobbying frameworks","responses":[{"response_id":"7","response_text":"They exist and are operational.","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.a.EXIST","subquestion_id":"15","subquestion_text":"Are there laws, policies, or regulations requiring collection or publication of this information in any form?"},{"response_id":"26","response_text":"Requirements to publish this information as open data are set out in binding policy, regulations, or law.","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.a.DATARULES","subquestion_id":"14","subquestion_text":"Do relevant laws, policies, regulations, or guidance discuss the publication of open data?"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e1.DEFINITIONS","subquestion_id":"265","subquestion_text":"The framework contains clear and unambiguous definitions of lobbyists, lobbying clients, lobbying activities, and public officials."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e1.IDENTITY","subquestion_id":"266","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of the identities of lobbyists, lobbyist clients, and public officials who engage with lobbyists."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e1.GOALS","subquestion_id":"267","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of information on lobbyists' goals for lobbying activities."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e1.TIMING","subquestion_id":"268","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of information on timing of lobbying activities."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e1.TOPICS","subquestion_id":"201","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of information on topics of lobbying activities."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e1.SPEND","subquestion_id":"166","subquestion_text":"The framework requires the collection and publication of information on how much money is spent on lobbying activities."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e2.AGENCY","subquestion_id":"13","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance empower an agency or official to ensure the accurate and timely collection and publication of required data."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e2.VERIFICATION","subquestion_id":"12","subquestion_text":"The framework requires a verification process."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e3.TIMELY","subquestion_id":"17","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance require that data is regularly updated."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.e.e3.STRUCTURED","subquestion_id":"16","subquestion_text":"The rules\/guidance support the collection of structured data."},{"response_id":"105","response_text":"The framework assessed covers the national government, but may have some exceptions or may not apply to other levels of government.","varname":"G.PI.LOBBY.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"132","subquestion_text":"How comprehensive, in terms of jurisdiction, is the lobbying framework assessed for this question?

Those rules are mostly incorporated in the Electoral Code for campaign finance and in the Law n\u00b088-227 of March 11 1988 (1), which is regularly updated (last substantial reform in september 2017). This is complemented by official guidelines published by the National Commission for Campaign Finance and Political Finance (CNCCFP) summarizing hard law and case law (2). Candidates and parties must comply with the same accounting guidelines, set by a National Accounting Authority (3). According to the Code Electoral, \u00ab the commission ensures the publication of campaign finance accounts in an open standard, easily reusable and machine-readable, and ensures their publication in the Official Journal. \u00bb (4)\n\nIn general, rules are stronger for campaign finance (all invoices must be reported to the CNCCFP, etc.) than for party finance (data only reported as summary) ; this can be explained by article 4 of the Constitution, which states that political parties \"carry out their activities freely\" (5).\n\nDespite this relatively strong processes on the paper, major scandals have occurred in the last decades, notably about the presidential elections (6) and illicit loans from foreign organisations (7). Therefore, civil society is actively calling for reforms to address loopholes (8).\n\nIn many cases, it is necessary to make a physical appointment and go on site to get access to some data, notably for supporting documents that are never available online. \n\n(1) Code Electoral https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/codes\/id\/LEGITEXT000006070239\/\n\nLaw n\u00b088-227 of 11 March 1988 on political finance transparency https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/id\/JORFTEXT000000321646\/2021-10-06\/ \n\n(2) CNCCFP. 2021. \"Guide du candidat et du mandataire\".

This independent agency is responsible for ensuring the proper implementation of RTI laws and procedures ; it processes complaints from citizens against public authorities when their first level requests failed, and issues pre-litigation opinions (\u00ab avis \u00bb) (1). This commission is required by law to regularly publish the list of all favorable opinions issued by the commission. This list specifies which administration is targeted, the reference of the administrative document requested, the reaction - if any - of the administration to this decision, as well as, when applicable, details on litigation (2). \n\nAll legally required data have to be published by the CADA as open data (3). \n\nIn addition, it should be noted that some data are collected and\/or published by the commission in practice, although this is not explicitly required by law (hence some negative answers in this survey even when data is collected and available). This is notably the case for data regarding how long it took the relevant government agency or agencies to fill requests, data regarding material withheld and the reasons for withholding it, and on the fact that information is linked to the relevant agency, department, or other governmental entity. In practice, the CADA publishes in its annual report (pdf - not open data) annual statistics on the number of requests received and processed (4) - although not explicitly required by law. More generally, the legal requirements targets favorable opinions only (3 - ibid), but the CADA publishes data for all kind of opinions (favorable and rejections) in practice.\n\nA specific comment should be made on data regarding appeals to RTI determinations and their results. Those data are required by law to be collected and published in theory, according to article 342-3 of the Code of Relations between Citizens and the Administration (3, ibid). However, in practice, the broader regulatory context does not provide the CADA with the adequate means to follow up those appeals exhaustively for two reasons. First, the requesting citizens do not necessarly inform the CADA about appeals, because appeal against first-level administrations (the CADA issues mandatory pre-litigation \u00ab opinions \u00bb that are not considered as administrative decisions subject to appeal). Second, there is no open data of legal decisions (reform is planned but was not yet implemented at the time of this survey) (5). In practice, the CADA watches closely all legal decisions and they are commented extensively in the CADA's annual reports (not in open data) (6).\n \nAlthough the answers in this survey focus primarily on the CADA, it is worth mentioning that, for first-level requests (requests sent by citizens to a given authority before the CADA is seized) are theoretically covered by the \"open data by default\" overarching principle (established by the \"Law for a Digital Republic\" passed in 2016, and applicable to all public agencies in all fields). (7) This principle could cover (at least in theory) data on RTI performance held by most public authorities but, to our knowledge, there isn't any example of a municipality or public agency publishing aggregated data on RTI performance (8).\n\n\n(1) Code of relations between citizens and the administration (CRPA).

Because many companies fail to conform to the French law, there's still no dedicated open datasets available on the governmental open data platform. \n\nSOURCES\n(1) LAW n\u00b0 2017-399 on the duty of due diligence of parent companies and ordering companies, March 27, 2017: https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/id\/JORFTEXT000034290626\/\n(2) Claire Chaudi\u00e8re, 2021, Devoir de vigilance des multinationales : une enqu\u00eate montre l'opacit\u00e9 et la faible application de la loi, France Inter: https:\/\/www.franceinter.fr\/societe\/devoir-de-vigilance-des-multinationales-une-enquete-montre-l-opacite-et-la-faible-application-de-la-loi\n(3) Syndex Union Trade: https:\/\/www.syndex.fr\/devoirdevigilance\n(4) Plan Vigilance consortium: https:\/\/plan-vigilance.org\/","evidence":[{"title":"LAW n\u00b0 2017-399 on the duty of due diligence of parent companies and ordering companies, March 27, 2017","link":"https:\/\/www.legifrance.gouv.fr\/loda\/id\/JORFTEXT000034290626\/"},{"title":"Claire Chaudi\u00e8re, 2021, Devoir de vigilance des multinationales : une enqu\u00eate montre l'opacit\u00e9 et la faible application de la loi, France Inter","link":"https:\/\/www.franceinter.fr\/societe\/devoir-de-vigilance-des-multinationales-une-enquete-montre-l-opacite-et-la-faible-application-de-la-loi"},{"title":"Syndex Union Trade","link":"https:\/\/www.syndex.fr\/devoirdevigilance"},{"title":"Plan Vigilance Consortium","link":"https:\/\/plan-vigilance.org\/"}],"indicator_id":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL","indicator_name":"Use (CI): Corporate due diligence","indicator_name_medium":"Due dilligence uses of data","indicator_name_short":"Due dilligence uses of data","responses":[{"response_id":"61","response_text":"One or more products\/services exist, but they do not appear to make use of open datasets.","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.a.PRODUCTS","subquestion_id":"283","subquestion_text":"Is there evidence of this data being used in products\/services?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.GOV","subquestion_id":"284","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products and services being promoted to, or used by, government."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.CSO","subquestion_id":"285","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products\/services being promoted to, or used by, civil society"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.PRIVATESECTOR","subquestion_id":"286","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products\/services being promoted to, or used by, the private sector."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e1.MEDIA","subquestion_id":"272","subquestion_text":"There is evidence of these products and services being promoted to, or used by, media."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e2.BO","subquestion_id":"287","subquestion_text":"There is evidence that at least one of the examples cited is making use of beneficial ownership data."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.e.e2.AI","subquestion_id":"20","subquestion_text":"At least one of the examples identified describes using artificial Intelligence or machine learning to process data"},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"U.COMPANY.DUEDIL.c.EXTENT","subquestion_id":"21","subquestion_text":"There is evidence that these uses have had or are having meaningful positive impacts."}]},{"score":"61","justification":"The open data available on land tenure and use are not widely to influence policy in the interests of equity and inclusion. \nThere's no mention of gender equity in land tenure in French advocacy campaigns, media articles and academic papers.\nOpen data on land tenure are used by real-estate companies (1).\nAn interesting research paper explained what are the risks and misuse of land use open data (2).\nLand use data are used for advocacy campaigns on climate change (3), reforestation (4) and agriculture (5) by nonprofit organizations.
