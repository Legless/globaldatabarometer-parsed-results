The General Law of Ecologic Equilibrium and Environment Protection mandates the establishment of this information system (1).\nThe SNIB takes information from projects donated or financed by them. The information is transformed into a common structure and stored in a data warehouse where it is cleaned, standardized, and completed (2). After that process, CONABIO publishes on different web pages such as Mexico's open data platform, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and \"Enciclovida.\"\nThe data used to answer the \"Data openness, timing, and structure\" section comes from the species catalog download option at the SNIB website (3). This option allows to download a bulk dataset or to request online information by taxonomic category. Information is free, but it asks for an e-mail to send the download link. The downside of this data is that there is no date of the last update, historical records, or clear license statement.\nSNIB has an option to download data by the specimen (4). This option has a date of update, some previous records, and specifies available licenses for each specimen example. However, this dataset was not used since it doesn't contain variables about endangered species, even though endangered categories are a filter to download the data.\nMexico's open data platform was not used since there are multiples and diverse datasets. For example, a search as \"species catalog\" returns over 84 datasets from different projects and locations of Mexico. A search as \"endangered species\" returns up to 67 datasets. Therefore, the SNIB's download option by species was selected since it allows finding information for different species using the same data structure and with the required variables.\n\nSources:\n(1) General Law of Ecologic Equilibrium and Environment Protection, article 80, fraction V. 1988.  http:\/\/www.diputados.gob.mx\/LeyesBiblio\/pdf\/148_180121.pdf\n(2) https:\/\/www.snib.mx\/ejemplares\/proceso\n(3) https:\/\/www.snib.mx\/taxonomia\/descarga\/\n(4) https:\/\/www.snib.mx\/ejemplares\/descarga\/","evidence":[{"title":"General Law of Ecologic Equilibrium and Environment Protection","link":"http:\/\/www.diputados.gob.mx\/LeyesBiblio\/pdf\/148_180121.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"A.CLIMATE.BIO","indicator_name":"Availability (CA): Biodiversity","indicator_name_medium":"Biodiversity data","indicator_name_short":"Biodiversity","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.MAMMALS","subquestion_id":"102","subquestion_text":"Data includes mammals."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.BIRDS","subquestion_id":"101","subquestion_text":"Data includes birds."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.REPTILES","subquestion_id":"100","subquestion_text":"Data includes reptiles."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.AMPHIBIANS","subquestion_id":"99","subquestion_text":"Data includes amphibians."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.FISH","subquestion_id":"98","subquestion_text":"Data includes fish."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.INVERTEBRATES","subquestion_id":"112","subquestion_text":"Data includes invertebrates."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.FUNGI","subquestion_id":"113","subquestion_text":"Data includes fungi and lichen."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.NVP","subquestion_id":"114","subquestion_text":"Data includes non-vascular plants."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.VP","subquestion_id":"115","subquestion_text":"Data includes vascular plants."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e1.GREENLIST","subquestion_id":"116","subquestion_text":"Data includes a \"green\" list, or detailed information on species or ecosystems recovering from danger, threat, or vulnerability."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.STANDARDS","subquestion_id":"22","subquestion_text":"The data is published according to one or more relevant data standards."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.VALIDATION","subquestion_id":"117","subquestion_text":"Data is nationally validated by the government."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.CONTRIB","subquestion_id":"27","subquestion_text":"A mechanism allows additional actors to contribute to the data repository."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e2.LIMITS","subquestion_id":"118","subquestion_text":"Limitations of the data are clearly stated."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.CLIMATE.BIO.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

According to the Open Data Platform, the last date of update of this dataset was 2021-06-09 (5), but another source from the Ministry of Health says that CRVS open data was last updated on 2020-11-23 (6), so this date was considered to justify its use. It was preferred over the Mortality dataset since it has a 2020 update.\n\nSources:\n(1) https:\/\/www.inegi.org.mx\/app\/descarga\/?t=126&ag=00\n(2) https:\/\/www.inegi.org.mx\/app\/descarga\/?t=127&ag=00\n(3) https:\/\/www.inegi.org.mx\/contenidos\/masiva\/indicadores\/temas\/natalidad\/natalidad_00_xlsx.zip\n(4) https:\/\/www.inegi.org.mx\/contenidos\/masiva\/indicadores\/temas\/mortalidad\/mortalidad_00_xlsx.zip\n(5) https:\/\/datos.gob.mx\/busca\/dataset\/defunciones\n(6) http:\/\/www.dgis.salud.gob.mx\/descargas\/datosabiertos\/defunciones\/descriptores\/DESCRIPTOR_CAMPOS_DEFUN_2019.zip\n(7) https:\/\/datos.gob.mx\/busca\/dataset\/nacimientos-ocurridos\/resource\/061a4009-b295-4744-8aeb-ceac4d1be5a7\n(8) http:\/\/www.dgis.salud.gob.mx\/contenidos\/basesdedatos\/da_defunciones_gobmx.html","evidence":[{"title":"DGIS","link":"http:\/\/www.dgis.salud.gob.mx\/contenidos\/basesdedatos\/da_defunciones_gobmx.html"},{"title":"INEGI births","link":"https:\/\/www.inegi.org.mx\/app\/descarga\/?t=126&ag=00"},{"title":"INEGI mortality","link":"https:\/\/www.inegi.org.mx\/app\/descarga\/?t=127&ag=00"}],"indicator_id":"A.HEALTH.CRVS","indicator_name":"Availability (H): Vital statistics","indicator_name_medium":"Vital statistics","indicator_name_short":"Vital statistics","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e1.COMPLETENESS","subquestion_id":"125","subquestion_text":"The data includes information on data limitations, specifically on the completeness of vital statistics in different provinces, counties, or regions of the country."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e1.DEATH","subquestion_id":"126","subquestion_text":"Cause of death is standardized to the International Classification of Causes of Death (ICD) or a related, fully interoperable standard."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.MORTALITY","subquestion_id":"128","subquestion_text":"Mortality information includes data about age, sex and\/or gender, geographic location, and cause of death."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.CHILD","subquestion_id":"146","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about sex and\/or assigned gender of child, gestational age, and birth weight."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.LIVEBIRTH","subquestion_id":"42","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about live-birth order and interval between last and previous live births to mother."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.BIRTHDETAILS","subquestion_id":"127","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about place of occurrence, place of usual residence of mother, and month of occurrence."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.BIRTHREG","subquestion_id":"120","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about place of registration and month of registration."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.MATERNAL","subquestion_id":"119","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about age, educational attainment, and ethnic and\/or national group of mother."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.PATERNAL","subquestion_id":"147","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about age of father and place of usual residence."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e2.PRENATAL","subquestion_id":"133","subquestion_text":"Birth information includes data about site of delivery, attendant at birth, and month in which prenatal care began."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.HEALTH.CRVS.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.

However, the budget spending dataset from the first quarter of 2021 was used to answer most of the \"Data fields and quality\" and the \"Data openness, timing, and structure\" sections. The reason is that this dataset covers all of the budget programs and classifications, has all of the federal government agencies, social security institutions, state-owned enterprises, some public corporations, and transfers to local governments. This dataset is regularly updated and has the necessary identifiers to connect with information regarding investment projects, performance indicators, and procurement processes.\nRegarding the question about open official tools available to explore the data, the answer was \"No\" even when Mexico has the Open Fiscal Data Package on its budget transparency platform (1). The reason is that the viewer is updated until 2019 while the dataset has a 2021 update.\nThe Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) has not evaluated Mexico (2), so this research used normative documents that set classifications to see if they were based on international standards. The administrative classification is based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2011 and Mexico's system of national accounts (3). The economic classification also follows the GFSM and Mexico's system of National Accounts (4). The Functional Classification follows the Classification of Functions of Government, GFSM 2001, and Mexico's system of national accounts (5). The program classification doesn't mention if it follows any standard (6), but the sub-question was answered as \"Yes\" using the PEFA criteria, which states that the program classification may substitute for subfunctional classification it has a level of detail corresponding to the subfunctional classification (7).\n\nSources:\n(1) https:\/\/www.transparenciapresupuestaria.gob.mx\/es\/PTP\/datos_presupuestarios_abiertos\n(2) https:\/\/development-data-hub-s3-public.s3.amazonaws.com\/ddhfiles\/94569\/wb_fmis_obd_dataset.xlsx\n(3) Acuerdo por el que se emite la clasificaci\u00f3n administrativa, I.

Currently, the Federal law of prevention and identification of transactions involving resources derived from illicit sources reform hasn't been approved by Congress; the objective of this reform is that institutions can identify beneficial owners better in vulnerable activities.

The foregoing includes a single data repository (2) that has machine-readable metadata, as well as standardized processes for the publication of datasets and for the management of their life cycle, including the storage of historical information, through specific committees by topic. The foregoing is established in its Internal Regulations (3).\n\nINEGI's repository includes different human and machine-readable formats for each data set, basic viewers and downloads in different formats, including remote processing queries through its Microdata Laboratory (4). The repository in general includes a feedback mechanism through a \"suggestion\" box, as well as a chat that provides guidance through direct online conversation with a specialist.\n\nAdditionally, the Executive Branch has a centralizing page for the Federal Government's open data that continues to be active (5) and through the \"Participate\" initiative, it collects citizen opinions on existing or potential data sets, which has an open consultation process unrelated to datasets from June 2021 but does not show historical information on past consultations on open datasets (6). However, this site has not received updates in the last year that are visible through its page, so it is considered that currently, the most relevant source of information in open formats as a single repository is that of INEGI.\n\nDespite this, in terms of processes, the initiative of the Executive Branch has a technical guide that frames the formats (7), the update cycles and the metadata (based on DCAT), but also the responsibilities, the processes of implementation and promotion of reuse (8). The data is kept in a centralized national repository of open data (based on CKAN). This process is supported by ADELA (9), a software developed by the government in conjunction with CodeandoMX (10) that allows agencies to publish their data sets and facilitates further monitoring of this process.\nNonetheless it is very important to note that the data management policy changed for all the Federal Government on the 30th of june of 2021 by the AGREEMENT by which the Transparency, Open Government and Open Data Policy of the Federal Public Administration 2021-2024 is issued (11) Therefore spamming out of the research period.

The combination of both apply to all the levels and branches of government. I would say the protection of personal data is extensive, as the relevant regulatory framework does not only promote the protection of the data and has been implemented in practice, but it complies with quality requirements such as providing the right of choice \/ consent of the people, the right to access and \/ or correct personal data, imposes clear responsibilities on those who guard the information (differentiating between the figuv  vc res of \"charged with\" and \"responsible\" for the data), and provides the right to redress against public and private bodies that violate data privacy.\n\nAdditionally, these regulations contemplate the procedures to anonymize before publication, which guarantees that sensitive and personally identifiable data are eliminated prior to any publication.\n\nIn fact, the right to the protection of personal data is only limited by exception provided in the aforementioned laws and is stipulated in the Political Constitution of the Mexican United States (3), in its article 16 as a fundamental right or individual guarantee that cannot be waived. Therefore, sanction mechanisms are provided for the infringement of personal data, ranging from warnings, to economic, civil and even criminal sanctions.\n\nThe autonomous body for the protection of personal data is the National Institute of Transparency, Access to Information and Protection of Personal Data (4), and constantly issues consultation material to facilitate understanding of the concept of personal data, disclose best practices on privacy and confidentiality notices and what to do if you consider a potential vulnerability of this right.

This law provides criteria about the minimum content and periodicity that the income law, proposed budget, in-year reports, and year-end reports should have. Other laws were used to specify additional spending, debt, or performance reports.\nThe Federal Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility was preferred to answer the \"Provisions for data quality\" since the General Law of Government Accountability only provides general criteria and barely specified responsible government institutions. The Federal Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility covers the federal government and state or local government reports when they spend federal resources. Specifics on this matter for state and local government would have to be looked at in each state's law.\nTo answer if open data is set out in binding policies, laws, or regulations, the keyword \"open data\" was searched in the whole framework. No results were found, except in the Budget Law from 2020. This law establishes that the Ministry of Finance has to publish open data for the proposed budget, the enacted budget, the quarterly spending reports, and the year-end report (2). However, this law is updated every year, and this article didn't appear in the 2021 budget, so it was answered that there only were requirements to publish data.\nThe Federal of Budget and Fiscal Responsibility, and the Genera Law of Budget Accountability, were used to answer the economic classification disaggregation level. The only specification found on this matter was in the federal law, which specifies that the enacted budget needs to have an annex with budget distribution by the administrative classification and the economic classification at the chapter and concept levels (3). These levels are the most aggregate ones (4).
