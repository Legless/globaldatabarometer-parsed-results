To have access to land tenure data, users have to sign a contract with the National Information Systems State Enterprise and receive the right to use from 5 000 to 750 000 queries via API (3). In addition, data is also available as a paid service for all users to get information about specific land tenure records (4). \n\nLand tenure data are not geospatial, but users can combine it with the land cadastre data via cadastre code, and coordinates can be extracted (5). \n\nAccording to the State Land Cadastre audit, data about five mln ha (its landowners) is missing and will be updated only after digitizing paper data (6). It can cause the problem that not all data are available via paid API.    \n\nSources (accessed 27 July 2021) \n(1) Land Cadastre Data: https:\/\/data.land.gov.ua\/\n(2) API documentation (in Ukrainian): https:\/\/nais.gov.ua\/files\/general\/2020\/05\/28\/20200528191932-71.docx\n(3) Draft agreement on access to API of the State Register of Real Rights https:\/\/nais.gov.ua\/files\/general\/2021\/07\/05\/20210705203344-39.pdf\n(4) Service for all users for specific records search: https:\/\/kap.minjust.gov.ua\/services?product_id=1\n(5) Land Cadastre Data: https:\/\/data.land.gov.ua\/\n(6) The National Agency on Corruption Prevention Report about land: https:\/\/nazk.gov.ua\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Ryzyky_pryvatyzatsiya_2011.pdf","evidence":[{"title":"API documentation","link":"https:\/\/nais.gov.ua\/files\/general\/2020\/05\/28\/20200528191932-71.docx"},{"title":"Draft of agreement on API access","link":"https:\/\/nais.gov.ua\/files\/general\/2021\/07\/05\/20210705203344-39.pdf"}],"indicator_id":"A.LAND.TENURE","indicator_name":"Availability (L): Land tenure","indicator_name_medium":"Land tenure data","indicator_name_short":"Land tenure","responses":[{"response_id":"4","response_text":"Data is available from government, or because of government actions.","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.a.ONLINE","subquestion_id":"1","subquestion_text":"Is this data available online in any form?"},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.INDIGENOUS","subquestion_id":"289","subquestion_text":"Datasets have information regarding indigenous people or marginalized populations."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.NATURALPERSONS","subquestion_id":"290","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving natural persons."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.LEGALPERSONS","subquestion_id":"291","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving legal persons."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.STATE","subquestion_id":"292","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving state land."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.COMMUNAL","subquestion_id":"293","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving communal lands."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.OPENACCESS","subquestion_id":"294","subquestion_text":"The data covers land tenure involving open access lands."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.TENURETYPE","subquestion_id":"295","subquestion_text":"The data covers urban and rural tenure, and other relevant forms of tenure."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e1.CONCESSIONS","subquestion_id":"296","subquestion_text":"The data covers and has information on land concessions and\/or leases."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.GEO","subquestion_id":"297","subquestion_text":"Each record has a geospatial reference that allows to assign features to a spatial extent."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.TRANSACTIONS","subquestion_id":"298","subquestion_text":"The data contains information on land transactions and sale-values."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.LANDRIGHTS","subquestion_id":"299","subquestion_text":"Each tenure record contains information about the rights held over the land (freehold, lease, etc.)."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e2.GENDER","subquestion_id":"23","subquestion_text":"Data includes information about individuals' sex and\/or gender."},{"response_id":"0","response_text":"No","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e3.FREE","subquestion_id":"7","subquestion_text":"Dataset is available free of charge."},{"response_id":"2","response_text":"Partially","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e3.LICENSE","subquestion_id":"6","subquestion_text":"Data is openly licensed."},{"response_id":"1","response_text":"Yes","varname":"A.LAND.TENURE.e.e3.LANG","subquestion_id":"5","subquestion_text":"Data is available in all the country\u2019s official or national languages.
